       "'BRUSSELS — European Union officials on Tuesday waded into the fight against international tax dodging, calling for the world’s biggest companies to disclose more data about their tax arrangements with the bloc’s member governments and to share information about offshore havens where they shelter money.The proposed new rules were in the planning before the recent leak of millions of documents from a Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca. But European officials tweaked the plans in recent days to pay more attention to offshore holdings in light of the revelations in the Panama Papers.The Mossack Fonseca files revealed how some of the world’s richest or most powerful people may have used offshore bank accounts and shell companies to conceal their wealth or avoid taxes. The European proposal is primarily aimed at stopping multinational companies from shifting their profits around Europe to lower their tax bills.Multinational companies including Amazon, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Apple, Google and Starbucks have been part of investigations by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, into the way some of the 28 member countries set taxes, including Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.A long political fight may lie ahead for the proposals to become law. The proposed rules would very likely meet resistance from some business groups and possibly even European governments that use tax inducements to attract companies and jobs.And the authorities in popular tax havens like the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands or the Channel Islands off Britain, might lobby to avoid being labeled “tax jurisdictions which do not respect international tax good governance standards” — as a European Union memo on the proposed rules stated, without naming any names. Deciding which jurisdictions end up the European Union’s blacklist could prove diplomatically sensitive.“Drafting these lists, and pulling up the right names for tax havens, is a very political process, that’s clear,” said Guntram B. Wolff, the director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “But the commission toughened up since the release of the Panama Papers, partly as the mood shifted and partly because of backing from France and Germany.”Commission officials emphasized on Tuesday that no decisions had been made about which countries might be included on the blacklist. And they promised to hold open discussions with any country under scrutiny.But in a news conference on Tuesday in Strasbourg, France, Jonathan Hill, the European commissioner for financial services, hinted at one country that could receive a close look. “If large multinationals active in Europe are paying tax in somewhere like Panama, to take one example,” Mr. Hill said, “they’d need to make that public.”Ray Smith, a lawyer in London with Clyde & Company who advises large companies on their tax affairs, said the Panama Papers scandal had “added grist to the mill of E.U. politicians calling for urgent reform.”But he also urged caution. “The concern is, as with any populist reforms, that any new rules made in haste may overlook the fact that low tax jurisdictions often play an important and legitimate role,” Mr. Smith said.The proposals might also be brandished by groups in favor of Britain’s leaving the European Union as evidence of “the strain of ever increasing E.U. regulation,” he said.There also was immediate opposition to the proposals from one major lobbying group for European businesses, which said the initiative went too far by usurping the role of the national tax authorities and by forcing companies to reveal too much.The proposals would make the European Union “a lone front-runner in terms of public disclosure” and they “risk undermining our attractiveness as a location for investment, particularly from overseas,” said Markus J. Breyer, the director general for BusinessEurope in Brussels.To become law, the rules would require the approval of the European Parliament and a majority of European Union governments. The rules would apply only to multinational companies with global revenues greater than 750 million euros a year, or about $855 million. That would include an estimated 6,000 companies doing business in Europe.Rather than establishing a central registry, the proposal would leave it to the bloc’s member states to enforce rules requiring companies to publish tax information on their corporate websites.The information, which would be broken down by country, would include the number of employees; net revenue, including money exchanged between third parties and between business units of a group; profit before tax; and income tax due and paid each year.High levels of accumulated earnings, such as profits that are not distributed but are held in certain countries, could be an indicator of attempts to avoid taxes.The European Commission chose not to require that even more information be released publicly after business groups warned against putting companies with European operations at a competitive disadvantage compared to other parts of the world.But for some advocates of tax overhauls, the rules do not go far enough because companies would mostly be allowed to publish aggregated data about their payments outside the European Union.“We still won’t know anything about the activities, tax payments and potential tax agreements by multinationals across most of the world,” said Elena Gaita, a policy officer in Brussels for Transparency International, which monitors corruption. “Another problem is that this environment is highly competitive,” she said, “so one country may not be a tax haven today but might become one tomorrow.”But the commission said the information would be sufficient to shame the companies that shift their profits mainly for tax purposes and would force them to consider changing their business practices.The overall transparency would “help the public see whether companies are acting in the best long-term interests of their shareholders from a reputational point of view,” Mr. Hill said at the news conference.Mr. Hill is an ally of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who has been embroiled in political uproar because of money he made through an offshore trust established by his father. That trust was identified in the Panama Papers. Mr. Cameron, who said neither he nor his father had done anything illegal, has released information from his tax returns for the last six years.The European Union accelerated its efforts to curb tax avoidance in the wake of the financial crisis, which forced many governments to adopt austerity budgets, reduce public services and raise nominal tax rates.Critics contend that because tax engineering by big corporations allowed some multinationals to skirt taxes, small businesses and individual citizens bore the brunt of the impact. Politicians and policy makers sensitive to that criticism have called for banks and big corporations to pay more tax and to be less secretive about where their money goes.Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner, has already ordered the Netherlands to recover back taxes from Starbucks and has told Belgium to do the same in the case of Anheuser-Busch InBev and a number of other companies.Ms. Vestager could still do the same in a pending case against Apple, which has a similar arrangement with Ireland, and in an inquiry into Amazon, which has a tax arrangement in Luxembourg.'"

      "LAS VEGAS –  Ben Affleck will direct a stand-alone \"Batman\" movie, says Warner Bros. chairman and CEO Kevin Tsujihara.\n",
      "Affleck portrayed the caped crusader in this year's \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" and had been rumored to be the studio's top choice to helm the film. Tsujihara confirmed they were moving forward with him in the director's seat Tuesday at CinemaCon, an annual gathering of theater owners in Las Vegas.\n",
      "The stand-alone Batman feature is part of Warner Bros. plans for an expanded DC Comics cinematic universe, similar to that of the Disney and Marvel collaboration. Warner Bros. has at least 10 features in the works, including \"Suicide Squad,\" ''Wonder Woman\" and \"Justice League.\" Unsurprisingly, those films comprised a major portion of Warner Bros.' presentation, signaling that the studio is moving forward energetically with its original plans despite reports that perhaps \"Batman v Superman\" is not performing as well at the box office as the studio would have liked.\n",
      "Affleck, who is also directing \"Live By Night\" for the studio, made an appearance with Amy Adams, who plays Lois Lane. He confirmed that both would be joining Zack Snyder's \"Justice League,\" which is currently in production in London.\n",
      "\"Suicide Squad\" director David Ayer and stars Will Smith and Margot Robbie were on hand as well to hype the supervillains-gone-straight pic, which launches on Aug. 5 with intense footage focusing heavily on Robbie's Harley Quinn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warner Bros. also trotted out stars and footage from a number of their upcoming films including the Harry Potter spinoff \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,\" ''The Lego Batman Movie,\" the Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling comedy \"The Nice Guys,\" and the Emilia Clarke romantic drama \"Me Before You.\"\n",
      "But beyond the individual films, a big focus was the studio's ongoing commitment to its filmmakers and the specialness of theatrical presentation.\n",
      "The threat of The Screening Room, a proposed at-home viewing experience of first-run movies, has loomed large over the annual conference where theater owners come not just to check out the new studio slates and mingle with stars, but to see the latest technologies that promise to enhance the theatrical experience for audiences. Major filmmakers like Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson have come out in support of the service, but the industry on the whole remains divided.\n",
      "\"I assure you we are not going to let a third party or middle man come between us,\" Tsujihara told the audience of exhibitors. \"When there are new technologies ... we will explore them with each of you. We know the status quo is not an option.\"\n",
      "Not every studio has taken a hard stand. On Monday, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" director J.J. Abrams — a Screening Room backer — urged the conference to be open-minded about innovations.\n",
      "\"Hangover\" director Todd Phillips on Tuesday, however, came out strongly against the idea of the Screening Room without mentioning it directly while promoting his new Jonah Hill and Miles Teller comedy \"War Dogs.\"\n",
      "\"Why are we in such a rush to turn movies into television? It doesn't make sense to me. Movies are special,\" Phillips said. \"We need to do everything we can to protect that part of the experience.\"\n",

      "McCarthy's win wasn't a total knockout. The Warner Bros. superhero smackdown starring Ben Affleck as the Dark Knight and Henry Cavill as the Man of Steel nabbed $23.4 million in its third weekend.

      "LOS ANGELES –  Word of mouth might be kryptonite for \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" which fell a steep 68 percent in its second weekend in theaters according to comScore estimates Sunday. The superhero pic earned an estimated $52.4 million over the weekend, easily besting the modest new openers like \"God's Not Dead 2\" and \"Meet the Blacks.\"\n",
      "The Zack Snyder movie cost a reported $250 million to produce and around $150 million to market, and has earned an estimated $261.5 million to date.\n",
      "It's a critical launching point for a series of interconnected movies in the DC Comics Universe from Warner Bros. that will include this year's \"Suicide Squad\" and next year's \"Wonder Woman\" and two \"Justice League\" movies, which is why its early performance — and hold — are being so intensely scrutinized.\n",
      "Superhero movies tend to be frontloaded with fans, and a near 60 percent fall is not uncommon for major blockbusters in weekend two.\n",
      "\"Sometimes the bigger they are the harder they fall,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, comScore's senior media analyst. \"This is often what happens when you have films that rank in the top 10 debuts of all time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Snyder's \"Man of Steel,\" for instance, fell 64.6 percent in its second weekend, and even \"The Dark Knight Rises\" dropped a hefty 61.4 percent. Things aren't terribly different in the Marvel universe either. Disney's \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" tumbled 59.4 percent and Fox's \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" plunged 64.2 percent.\n",
      "Also, the first week \"Batman v Superman\" haul included the $27.7 million from Thursday night preview showings, whereas the second weekend sum does not account for those. The Friday of Easter weekend is also a holiday for many, making a straight comparison not entirely equitable.\n",
      "Still, 68 percent is on the steeper side for a second week fall. Last year's much derided \"Fantastic Four\" reboot fell 68.2 percent and the divisive \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" dropped 69 percent in 2009.\n",
      "In weekend one, many wondered whether the poor reviews would kill the film out of the gates, but it ended up earning $166 million regardless.\n",
      "\"This has been a poster child in illustrating the disconnect between critics and audience,\" Dergarabedian said.\n",
      "The second weekend, however, is where word of mouth starts to come into play, and on the fence audiences must decide whether or not it's worth their time and money.\n",
      "But, the near future still looks promising for \"Batman v Superman,\" which has the skies to itself for the next week until Disney's \"The Jungle Book\" opens on April 15. It's still doing major business internationally too, with $85.1 million in earnings this weekend, bringing its global total to $687.9 million.\n",
      "The weekend overall is down significantly from last year, which saw the massive opening of \"Furious 7.\"\n",
      "Disney's \"Zootopia\" held on to second place with a robust $20 million, bringing its domestic total to $275.9 million. \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2\" took third in its second week with $11.1 million.\n",
      "Rounding out the top five were two faith-based films, Pure Flix's \"God's Not Dead 2,\" which opened in fourth with $8.1 million, and \"Miracles From Heaven,\" which took in $7.6 million in its third weekend, bringing its total to $46.8 million. \"God's Not Dead 2\" did not do as well as the first movie, which opened to $9.2 million on about half as many screens, but, Dergarabedian notes that it is \"still a winner as these films cost very little to make.\"\n",
      "Freestyle Releasing's \"The Purge\" parody, \"Meet the Blacks,\" meanwhile earned only $4.1 million for an eighth place debut.\n",
      "Limited release openings like Richard Linklater's college baseball comedy \"Everybody Wants Some!!\" did well bringing in $323,000 from 19 theaters, while Don Cheadle's Miles Davis biopic \"Miles Ahead\" launched in four theaters to $122,751.\n",

      "NEW YORK –  Faster than a speeding bullet and impervious to lousy reviews, the superhero faceoff \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" rebounded from a smack down from critics to debut with a massive $170.1 million in North America, the sixth best opening of all-time.\n",
      "The stakes were high for the Warner Bros. release, which cost $250 million to make and about $150 million to market. But the studio's bid to launch a DC Comics universe to rival Marvel's empire was met with persistent PR pains and numerous changes in the release date.\n",
      "It fought skepticism over Ben Affleck's casting as Batman and a barrage of bad reviews earlier in the week. Things were bad enough to spawn a ubiquitous viral video of \"Sad Ben Affleck,\" which took the actor's response to the reviews and scored it with Simon & Garfunkel's \"The Sound of Silence.\"\n",
      "But the allure of seeing two of the most iconic superheroes battle it out was enough to set a record for the best pre-summer debut. \"Batman v Superman\" also grossed $254 million overseas, bringing its global total to $424.1 million for the weekend.\n",
      "The mighty debut was met with a huge sigh of relief by Warner Bros. which invested its full marketing power in \"Batman v Superman.\" The film, directed by Zack Snyder, is the first of 10 DC Comics adaptations planned by the studio over the next five years. Along with pitting Henry Cavill's Superman against Batman, it introduces a number of other heroes soon to get starring roles, including Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and the Flash (Ezra Miller).\n",
      "\n",
      "Audiences gave the film a mediocre B CinemaScore, which suggested some moviegoers agreed with critics. But many fans (a good number of whom bought tickets well in advance) were undeterred.\n",
      "\"There was a disconnect there between what critics wrote and the fan interest,\" said Jeff Goldstein, head of distribution for Warner Bros. \"What we're seeing is a huge amount of repeat business.\"\n",
      "\"Batman v Superman\" dominated Easter weekend with the kind of blockbuster performance usually reserved for Memorial Day or July 4th. In second was the Disney Animation hit \"Zootopia,\" with $23.1 million in its fourth week of domestic release. The go-to family release of the season, it has earned nearly $700 million globally. Universal's \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2,\" a sequel to the 2002 hit romantic comedy, debuted with $18.1 million — effective counterprogramming to the male-centric \"Batman v Superman.\"\n",
      "Opening well above the $116.6 million debut of Snyder's Superman reboot \"Man of Steel,\" ''Batman v Superman\" again proved that among comic-book heroes, Batman (who took first billing from Superman, naturally) is second to none. The opening surpasses previous Batman installments \"The Dark Knight Rises\" ($160.9 million) and \"The Dark Knight\" ($158.4 million).\n",
      "\"It proves that the concept is bigger than negative reviews,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. \"There was no way that if you're a comic book fan or just a movie fan that you're going to miss out on a match-up of such iconic characters. Audiences have to see the movie for themselves.\"\n",
      "The big weekend also breaks a poor stretch for Warner Bros., which was hobbled by a number of underperforming releases like \"In the Heart of the Sea,\" ''Pan\" and \"Point Break.\" If the estimate Sunday holds, \"Batman v Superman\" will be Warner Bros.' best opening ever, topping \"Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2\" ($169.2 million).\n",
      "\"We all know that studios have dips and you can't hit it out of the ballpark every time, although we try,\" Goldstein said. \"And we had a little bit of a dip in 2015, no question. We always believed in our upcoming slate. We knew it was just a matter of getting to the films.\"\n",
      "Whether word-of-mouth will be good enough to help \"Batman v Superman\" maintain its record-setting pace in the coming weeks remains to be seen, but the March release date means it will have little competition. The film soaked up IMAX, 3-D and large-format screens, drawing a 62 percent male audience.\n",
      "\"At the end of the day, a superhero movie can be a box-office superhero any month of the year,\" Dergarabedian said. \"For Warner Bros., this is a seminal moment. It proves how quickly fortunes can rise and fall based on your slate of films. This was a bet that paid off really big for the studio.\"\n",
      "Warner Bros. will hope the success continues for its next DC Comics property, the all-villain team-up film \"Suicide Squad,\" due out in August. Marvel and the Walt Disney Co. may also have been eyeing the result of \"Batman v Superman\" with interest. Their next installment comes in May with \"Captain America: Civil War,\" which likewise pits two heroes (Iron Man and Captain America) against each other.\n",
      "Such a clash may feel like a repeat to moviegoers. More likely, \"Batman v Superman\" whetted appetites for more superhero-on-superhero violence.\n",
      "Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n",

      "Ben Affleck might be Batman to his 4-year-old fan-boy son, Samuel, but that doesn't mean he'll get to see his dad in action in \"Batman v Superman\" with the rest of the world when it hits theaters next week.\n",
      "\"Four years old is a little young to see this whole movie,\" Affleck said in a Friday interview. \"I don't want him to have nightmares.\"\n",
      "Click here to subscribe to FOX411’s YouTube channel\n",
      "Affleck has often said he partly took on the role for his three kids — his son in particular. And from dressing up as the dark knight for Samuel's themed birthday party to tipping the FedEx delivery guy a few bucks to stage a fake fight just because Samuel believes that he's the Joker, it's a part that hasn't gone away for Affleck when the cameras stop rolling, especially with the starry-eyed youngster around.\n",
      "Samuel has seen his dad in trailers for the film and whatever footage is available online, though, and, according to Affleck, those two-minute clips are basically \"his whole attention span anyway.\"\n",

      "Affleck said at the very least, his oldest daughter, Violet, 10, can see the PG-13 rated film. In addition to Violet and Samuel, Affleck and Jennifer Garner also have a 7-year-old daughter, Seraphina. The couple separated last year after 10 years of marriage.\n",

      "Batman. Superman. Iron Man. Spider-Man. Ant-Man. It’s fair to say that the superhero film phenomenon that has dominated the box office for the past decade has overwhelmingly been a boys’ club.\n",

      "\n",
      "FIRST REVIEW: Leigh Paatsch gives verdict on Batman V Superman\n",
      "FIRST LOOK: fans divided over Gal Gabot’s Wonder Woman\n",
      "Gal Gadot wants to change all that. While the character she plays, Wonder Woman, is one of the smaller players in Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, she’s one of the biggest deals in DC comic book universe — and makes one hell of an impression.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next year Gadot will be one of the first females to headline her own major superhero movie, a Wonder Woman origin story currently filming in Europe, beating Marvel’s announced but uncast Captain Marvel to the punch by a couple of years. And it’s about damn time.\n",
      "“I couldn’t agree more,” says the Israeli actor with a laugh. “Why has it taken so long? I’m not the one to ask this question. But I am definitely pleased with the fact that we are bringing Wonder Woman back to life and I think it is such an important thing for young girls — and boys — to have a strong female role model. The more the merrier and I hope we are starting a trend here.\n",
      "“Ever since I became an actress I said I wanted to show the stronger side of women. Little did I know that soon after I would land this part.”\n",
      "Gender inequality has been a hot topic in Hollywood in recent times, dragged into the spotlight by Patricia Arquette’s Oscar acceptance speech last year as well as the Sony hacking scandal that highlighted the disparity in pay between similarly qualified male and female actors.\n",
      "Gadot, a beauty queen and model turned actor who also spent two years in the Israeli army, says she has been lucky so far, but that there is still a lot of work to be done.\n",
      "“We definitely need more female writers and moviemakers and I truly believe we are in such an interesting era for women in all fields of life,” she says. “There is a good, good, good momentum for women and I hope that it will continue going and the more we have the better.”\n",
      "But illustrating the point that Gadot is a trailblazing woman operating in a very blokey world was the internet reaction upon her casting as Wonder Woman. Of all the fantastical aspects of the long-running, beloved character, what was singled out for the most rigorous scrutiny?\n",
      "Gadot’s boobs, which apparently needed to be bigger.\n",
      "“You know, men,” Gadot says with a laugh and just hint of exasperation. “Every one of them is obsessed with breasts. Honestly, it amused me. It was funny for me that it’s such an amazing character and all they have to critique is her bust. Me, as a person, I try not to pay too much attention to all the noise that comes when I get cast for something. Even if it’s good or even if it’s bad — because one day it’s good and the other day it’s bad, so I’d rather not pay attention to either.”\n",
      "Wonder Woman aka Diana Prince — a 5000-year-old Amazonian warrior princess from the fictional island of Themyscira — first appeared in DC Comics in 1942 and has been published almost continuously since then. But Gadot’s incarnation in Batman V Superman is far from the cheesy 1970s TV series starring Lynda Carter that most people think of as Wonder Woman.\n",
      "Born in 1985, Gadot is too young to remember Carter with her star-spangled hot pants and magic lasso. But the actor insists hers is a Wonder Woman for the world. On landing on the part, she had more than 75 years of comic book lore to draw on, as well as centuries of Greek mythology.\n",
      "“This Wonder Woman is very different to the Wonder Woman you saw in the TV series back in the ’70s,” she says. “We are very loyal to the original story. Diana came from Themyscira, an island, she knows hundreds of languages, she has been around for 5000 years. (Director) Zack Snyder had a vision of the Wonder Woman he wanted to bring back and what story he wanted to tell. I had to come on board and embody everything and give my own notes and input and go for it.\n",
      "“She is universal — she’s not just for women or girls, she’s not just for America or the Middle East, this is a Wonder Women for everyone.”\n",
      "Gadot initially thought she was auditioning for the part of Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) when she was asked to read with the new Batman, Ben Affleck.\n",
      "She was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls and is said to have narrowly beaten out former Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko and French actor Elodie Yung, who plays Elektra in the Netflix TV series Daredevil.\n",
      "“When we met Gal Gadot, it was unanimous among us that she was special, that she personified Wonder Woman,” says producer Deborah Snyder. “And as we got to know her and saw how she interacted with everyone, we knew that she was the right fit. Wonder Woman represents love and truth and sexual equality. Gal really embodies those characteristics.”\n",
      "Gadot also had to look the part: she gained 8kg of muscle and trained in Kung Fu, jiu-jitsu and sword play. She already had some action chops thanks to her appearances as revhead Gisele in the Fast and Furious franchise, not to mention the two years she spent as a combat instructor in the Israel Defence Forces, but still she endured nine months of gruelling training to nail the physicality of the character.\n",
      "“In the Fast and Furious movies I had to go through a different type of preparation,” she says. “It was about knowing how to do drifting with a car and how to use weapons etc. In this one, Wonder Woman is a warrior and she does hand to hand combat so I needed to learn different types of martial arts and how to fight with a sword and how to ride a horse and it was great. It was fun.”\n",
      "This story first appeared in news.com.au.\n",
