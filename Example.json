        "Publication": "New York Times",
        "Text": "BEVERLY HILLS, CALIF. \u2014 Like many successful actors, Iwan Rheon, better known as the blithely malicious Ramsay Bolton on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d arguably the most hated man on television, admits he\u2019s concerned about being narrowly defined by an indelible character. But ask a logical follow-up question \u2014 what else are you working on? \u2014 and the scale of his challenge becomes clear.\u201cI\u2019m playing a young Hitler,\u201d he replied, referring to the British television movie \u201cAdolf the Artist.\u201d Then realization took hold, and his face crumpled in mock despair: \u201cOh, I\u2019m typecast already!\u201dSuch is life for the man behind a character who, over three seasons on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d returning Sunday on HBO, has become the emblem of a disquieting show\u2019s darkest impulses. Since arriving as a one-note sadist in Season 3, this striving, legitimized former bastard has expanded to both embody the story\u2019s dynastic obsession and inflict some of its most flagrant abuses. That list includes the flaying and gelding of rivals, the recreational hunting of a girl and, most controversial, last season\u2019s wedding-night rape of his hostage bride, Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner).That he does it all with schoolboy glee makes him that much more viscerally loathsome \u2014 Mr. Rheon conceived Ramsay as a mash-up of Heath Ledger\u2019s unhinged Joker and Dennis the Menace, he said, and added a bit of the swagger of Liam Gallagher, the dyspeptic former Oasis singer. The resulting confection has landed on many \u201cmost-hated\u201d lists online. In December, readers of The Atlantic voted Ramsay \u201cthe actual worst character on television\u201d over the likes of Hannibal Lecter and Walter White, as well as Joffrey Baratheon, the sneering boy-king Ramsay replaced as the signature \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d villain.\u201cAfter we lost Joffrey, we had a psychopath-shaped hole in the \u2018Thrones\u2019 world,\u201d Ms. Turner wrote in an email. \u201cBut Iwan brings a terror and a creepiness that Joffrey never had. We needed someone to hate, and we love to hate him.\u201dIn the new season, the show\u2019s sixth, Ramsay deepens further, Mr. Rheon suggested, even approaching something like human emotion in mourning a girlfriend killed in the Season 5 finale. \u201cThat surprised even me,\u201d he said. Of course, it also finds him seething over last season\u2019s escape of his captives Sansa and Theon (Alfie Allen) \u2014 the young nobleman he castrated, forced into servitude and renamed Reek \u2014 and sets up who may be his most appalling victim yet: an as-yet-unborn stepsibling who could be a competing heir.[ \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has moved past its blueprint. That\u2019s a good thing. ]The show\u2019s creators, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, so obsessed with secrecy this season they\u2019ve declined to offer critics advance screener copies, will say only that Ramsay will be up to \u201cvery bad things.\u201d\u201cSometimes you just think, \u2018Oh God, can\u2019t we just do something nice?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rheon said, laughing. \u201cOn this show, the heroes aren\u2019t necessarily standard heroes, so I guess your villains need to be even worse.\u201dMr. Rheon, 30, wears the most-hated mantle easily. By all accounts a charming young Welshman \u2014 his name is pronounced OO-wan re-OHN, and he grew up in Cardiff and now lives in London \u2014 he is amused by the notoriety and claims it is \u201can honor\u201d to be considered the most despicable thing on a show full of despicable things. \u201cApparently I\u2019m scarier than a White Walker. And a giant. And a dragon,\u201d he said.In general, fans don\u2019t hold Ramsay\u2019s actions against him, and the technical realities of production keep the vile deeds from weighing too heavily on his soul. Flayings, for example, involve a piece of rubber and a prop knife he has to hold just so for the light to catch its malevolent angles, making it hard to obsess over the moral dimensions.One exception was Sansa\u2019s rape last season, which \u201cwas very difficult to me; I couldn\u2019t really sleep the night before,\u201d he said. Like others on the show, however, he remains somewhat perplexed by the outrage it sparked, less by the anger itself than by the scale and selective nature of it. A few episodes later, he noted, the immolation of a little girl drew a comparatively muted response. \u201cI don\u2019t want to compare these things and which is worse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut burning a child at the stake? That\u2019s pretty bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201dFor a man known for onscreen villainy, Mr. Rheon could hardly be more off-brand in conversation. Self-deprecating and solicitous, he is given to wisecracks and silly tangents \u2014 asked his own favorite screen scoundrels, he listed Stringer Bell from \u201cThe Wire\u201d and the T. rex from \u201cJurassic Park.\u201d Perhaps most jarring for \u201cThrones\u201d fans: He spends his spare time writing and recording folk-pop tunes, mostly on his own but occasionally with his brother, Aled. Last year he released his first album, \u201cDinard.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just a really nice fellow,\u201d said Mr. Allen, the target of Ramsay\u2019s most gruesome depredations. \u201cI couldn\u2019t put a finger on why he makes a good psychopath.\u201d (The actors, friends off camera, occasionally encounter incredulous fans who are stunned to see them spending time together. \u201cIt\u2019s like, do you believe in dragons, too, mate?\u201d Mr. Allen said.)In person, removed from the dank interiors he typically haunts on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Mr. Rheon\u2019s face is more cherubic than demonic, with a rakish scruff and artfully tousled hair that gets more so as he runs his hands through it in conversation. What defines him, though, are a pair of arresting pale blue eyes that tend to bulge maniacally on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d alight with the delight that comes from some cruelty or another.\u201cHe has this stare, this wide-eyed smiling gaze that pierces right through you,\u201d Ms. Turner said.Born in Carmarthen, Mr. Rheon and his family moved to Cardiff when he was 5, and he grew up playing in punk bands and dreaming of rock stardom. But participation in the Eisteddfod, a major culture festival in Wales, led to him being cast in a Welsh soap opera, and he went on to study at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. His breakthrough role came not long after he graduated, as the suicidal Moritz in a 2009 London production of the musical \u201cSpring Awakening.\u201dThe role was one of the first of many troubled, tormented or otherwise odd folks he\u2019d be hired to play. He was an awkward juvenile delinquent in \u201cMisfits,\u201d a skewed superhero series in Britain; an erratic drug dealer in the film \u201cWild Bill\u201d; and a traumatized soldier in the BBC war drama \u201cOur Girl.\u201d (An exception: his gig as the earnest neighbor to Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi on the British sitcom \u201cVicious.\u201d)For \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Mr. Rheon originally auditioned for the role of the heroic (and theoretically dead) Jon Snow, which instead went to Kit Harington. But his talent and versatility kept him \u201con our radar,\u201d Mr. Benioff and Mr. Weiss wrote in a joint email; he joined the show as Ramsay in Season 3. \u201cThe spark of humanity that Iwan occasionally provides makes all the other stuff that much more terrifying.\u201dRamsay\u2019s season-long torture of Theon tested viewers\u2019 patience, but he acquired texture as it became clear that he\u2019s fueled by a toxic cocktail of adoration and resentment toward his father, Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton). The combination of \u201cthe little boy and the psychopath\u201d makes Ramsay \u201cmore than a cardboard cutout evil baddie,\u201d Mr. McElhatton said. It also situates him firmly within the brutal, multigenerational cycle of legacy and revenge that makes \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d go \u2014 even if the actor still isn\u2019t sure why he fits in so well.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out what it is, but it\u2019s so difficult to objectively look at why you get cast as all these strange people,\u201d Mr. Rheon said. \u201cThe big eyes, maybe.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d",

        "Text": "On Sunday, April 24, Westeros \u2014 or at least its frequent visitors \u2014 will be liberated. With Season 6, HBO\u2019s fantasy saga \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will move past the story line of \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire,\u201d the uncompleted series of George R. R. Martin novels that it is based on.For those of you who haven\u2019t read the books, good news: Those of us who have will finally have to shut our smug pie holes. No more can we tease, \u201cWait until you see what happens!,\u201d as we did before the deadly Red Wedding or the deadly Purple Wedding. Any future murderous nuptials, and their color schemes, will surprise us, too.Will the Boltons be driven from Winterfell? You tell us. Will Daenerys and her dragons retake the Iron Throne for the Targaryens? (Shrugs.) Is Jon Snow dead, or at least permanently dead? We don\u2019t think so, either, but we can\u2019t prove it.Among readers, the Great Catch-Up has caused angst. It\u2019s highly unusual for an adaptation to begin behind its literary source only to overtake it. Will we be spoiled? Will it be the same to read Mr. Martin\u2019s next books \u2014 when and if he ever finishes them \u2014 with images from TV already squatting in our imaginations?Fear not. For readers, this is an opportunity to learn that a great novel is more than its plot. For viewers, this means that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 always an awe-inspiring spectacle but sometimes plodding and frustrating \u2014 can become its own thing.To some readers, the ideal screen adaptation is essentially a video illustration of the book: the thing that was in our heads, projected for us on a screen. Think of how some \u201cHarry Potter\u201d fans practically watched the movies with a checklist, praising them for how much of the source material they retained.But book-based series succeed best when they choose to \u2014 or have to \u2014 declare independence. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d became one of TV\u2019s best shows in Season 2, when it exhausted the Tom Perrotta book. Syfy\u2019s \u201cThe Magicians\u201d took a scissors to the narrative of Lev Grossman\u2019s fantasy novels, becoming nimble and funny in a screen-friendly way. Starz\u2019s \u201cOutlander\u201d took liberties with Diana Gabaldon\u2019s narrative but kept its spirit.It has become common to compare complex serials like HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Wire\u201d to novels \u2014 the implication/insult is that TV should be flattered \u2014 but the analogy goes only so far. TV is visual, telegraphic and more linear. Above all, it\u2019s unforgivingly fast. Mr. Martin has written five novels in two decades. A showrunner who promised HBO that pace would quickly be shown the Moon Door.\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d may have taken awhile to find its identity in part because the novels seemed so perfect for TV \u2014 for HBO in particular, even though its first volume appeared three years before \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201dLike the western \u201cDeadwood,\u201d it took a popular genre, dirtied it up and added politics and psychology. Its ideas about power \u2014 for instance, that leaders can be doomed by rigid purity \u2014 muddied the moral dichotomies of Tolkienesque fantasy. Whacking its seeming protagonist, the principled Ned Stark, was a mission statement made for pay cable.But the early episodes of \u201cThrones\u201d were burdened with the books\u2019 stature and vast story. The changes that were made, like Daenerys\u2019s wedding-night rape (a warning sign that the series would use sexual violence clumsily and too much) seemed to exist mainly for shock.\u201cThrones\u201d found its voice in \u201cThe Wolf and the Lion,\u201d the fifth episode of that first season. The soon-to-be-late king, Robert Baratheon, sits with his wife, Cersei Lannister, to share red wine \u2014 their only common interest \u2014 and assess the sorry state of their realm. Westeros is troubled by schemers and threatened by invasion, and the only thing holding it together is their hateful marriage of convenience. \u201cDon\u2019t you get tired?\u201d he asks her, ruefully. \u201cEvery day,\u201d she says.It\u2019s a masterly exchange. In a few minutes, it lays bare their bitter relationship. It gives depth to the queen, who might otherwise come across a simple fairy-tale villain. It establishes the series\u2019 perspective on the personal toll of political gamesmanship. And it appears nowhere in the novels.For all its stunning set pieces \u2014 the battles of the Blackwater and Hardhome, the duel between Oberyn Martell and Gregor (the Mountain) Clegane \u2014 \u201cThrones\u201d at heart is a series of conversations. Varys and Littlefinger. Jaime and Brienne. Tywin and Arya. Cersei and Lady Olenna. Tyrion and \u2026 well, anyone. In the Season 5 finale, the swordsman Daario, assessing Tyrion\u2019s suitability for a search party, sums up his abilities: \u201cSo mainly you talk.\u201d It\u2019s true \u2014 and it\u2019s why Tyrion, a disinherited dwarf, is the series\u2019 most dangerous character.Mr. Martin\u2019s anvil-size books are more expansive. They include vast downloads of Westeros history and religion, outlines of genealogy and toothsome descriptions of banquets, which are vivid on the page \u2014 and should stay there. \u201cThrones\u201d has lost some of the books\u2019 majesty, but it has given them a much-needed edit, a Valyrian sword hacking through the expository clutter.It\u2019s been a good marriage, but it\u2019s past time for a separation. \u201cThrones\u201d slowed to a jog in Season 5, and story lines like Jaime and Bronn\u2019s road trip to Dorne were advertisements for the fast-forward button. Even if the rest of the series follows Mr. Martin\u2019s plans (the showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss have worked in consultation with him), it may be better off for being TV first, without the anxiety of a best seller\u2019s influence.Which version will be authentic? Each will be authentically itself. Sometimes a story doesn\u2019t have a single, definitive narrative. Artworks evolve, be they the variants of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, Kanye West\u2019s revisions to \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d or George Lucas\u2019s edits to \u201cStar Wars.\u201d We grasp at canonicity \u2014 Han shot first! \u2014 to deal with uncertainty. But while we can argue which version is better, no one, not even Mr. Martin, can end the argument. \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d is not the novelization of \u201cThrones,\u201d and now \u201cThrones\u201d can be more than the serialization of the novels.I\u2019ll watch the new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as soon as it airs (HBO is not sharing it in advance with critics). I\u2019ll read Mr. Martin\u2019s final books whenever they come. It doesn\u2019t matter which gets there first, because there is no single \u201cthere.\u201d They share the same world, but they\u2019re two different continents, separated by a narrow sea.",

        "Text": "The sixth season of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d beginning April 24, might be the show\u2019s last full-length one, if the creators get their way.Seasons of the sprawling HBO fantasy epic have traditionally included 10 episodes, but David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the creators of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d said in an interview with Variety that they are considering wrapping up the series with two abbreviated seasons that amount to a total of 13 episodes.\u201cI think we\u2019re down to our final 13 episodes after this season,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe\u2019re heading into the final lap. That\u2019s the guess, though nothing is yet set in stone, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at.\u201dThe trimmed schedule would include seven episodes next season, and six in an eighth and final one. HBO countered that \u201cany conversations about the end of \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and the number of episodes of future seasons is purely speculative.\u201d\u201cAs is customary, HBO will sit with Dan and David to discuss the details once a decision has been made to go forward with Season 7,\u201d HBO said in a statement.Technically \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has only been secured through the end of Season 6 but HBO has long had plans to extend the show to at least eight seasons. Michael Lombardo, HBO\u2019s president of programming, said in January that the two sides were close to an extension. While it hasn\u2019t officially happened yet, the show is expected to begin shooting Season 7 this summer.Mr. Lombardo has been open about his desire to keep the show going as long as he can, despite its heavy production costs. To capture the story\u2019s various diverse and exotic settings, the production can include as many as four separate units shooting simultaneously in Ireland, Spain and Croatia, among other far-flung locales.\u201cAs a television executive, as a fan, do I wish they said another six years?\u201d Mr. Lombardo said to Variety. \u201cI do.\u201dIt should be noted that the \u201cThrones\u201d creators have previously extended their stated horizon for the show. In 2014 they said \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d would likely go for seven seasons, though eight now appears to be the plan.",

        "Text": "I had many questions for Peter Dinklage.I wanted to know how he feels about being the first dwarf heartthrob. I was curious why his 4-year-old daughter is named Zelig. I wondered what it was like to elope to Vegas.But first, I had to ask about the dragons.The \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star is such a big animal lover that he\u2019s a vegetarian who eats tofu masquerading as meat in the carnivorous, libidinous show.So now that the global hit \u2014 Season 6 starts in two weeks \u2014 has brought his character, the wily and louche \u201chalfman\u201d and \u201cperverse little imp\u201d Tyrion Lannister, into the sun-baked realm of Daenerys Targaryen, was it fun to act with the dragons? Or were they temperamental divas who chewed \u2014 or incinerated \u2014 the scenery?\u201cThey\u2019re not real,\u201d he says, looking at me solemnly with his big, droopy blue eyes.Whaaaaa? I am shocked, given the C.I.A.-level secrecy around the HBO show \u2014 which has sometimes confiscated extras\u2019 cellphones and this year declined to provide the press with episodes in advance \u2014 that Dinklage would let such a huge spoiler slip out. (On a less top-secret note, HBO plans to make a comedy pilot inspired by my book \u201cAre Men Necessary?\u201d)\u201cThe dragons are just a projection,\u201d Dinklage says in his melodious baritone. \u201cAh, working with something that is not there. Sometimes I work with some actors who aren\u2019t fully there. The guys in the visual effects department show you pre-visualizations, pre-vis. It used to be just storyboards, but now they\u2019re really well done on computers, and you see the whole scene with you and the animated dragons before you do it, so you get that in your head. It\u2019s neat. It\u2019s cool. I like it.\u201dThis season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d will be the first to venture beyond George R. R. Martin\u2019s books, like the medieval globe with unexplored territories labeled, \u201cHere be dragons.\u201dSeason 5 ended with Tyrion offering to be Dick Cheney to Emilia Clarke\u2019s Daenerys and to help her conquer and rule the Seven Kingdoms.\u201cYou can\u2019t compare her to Eleanor Roosevelt, I suppose,\u201d Dinklage says. \u201cShe\u2019s so much cooler.\u201dI ask him about his comment to Entertainment Weekly that, given the propensity for very sudden deaths on the show, the pair could \u201cgo out in a blaze of glory \u2014 boom, boom, Bonnie and Clyde.\u201d Would he prefer that to the Iron Throne?\u201cI think they should dismantle the Iron Throne,\u201d he replies saucily. \u201cSmelt it down and give it to the poor. It\u2019s very uncomfortable. They would have let the queen of England sit down on it, but she didn\u2019t. But, you know, she\u2019s an elderly lady, and having sat on it myself, I could understand why. It\u2019s made of swords. Sometimes your bum gets stuck for a second.\u201dDoes he ever think about the show in terms of modern politics?\u201cYou think Trump will start using trial by combat?\u201d he asks slyly.I point out that Tyrion and Trump both felt compelled to dispel doubts about their manhood.\u201cYeah, that was a classy debate, huh?\u201d the actor laughs. \u201cWow. Life and TV are becoming like the big crossover episode.\u201d(Dan Weiss, one of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d creators and writers, says Trump reminds him of Hodor, a gigantic dimwit who answers every question with one word: his name.)I\u2019m sitting with Dinklage, who\u2019s sporting a vest over a black hoodie, black jeans, Blundstones and a mop of uncombed hair, in the Blue Room atop the chic Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He has Patti Smith\u2019s latest memoir with him. His idols are the cool people who don\u2019t strive to be cool \u2014 Smith, Lou Reed, Tobias Wolff and Sam Shepard.The 46-year-old remarks that he lived five blocks away back in the \u201990s, after Bennington College, when he was trying to make it as an actor and supporting himself with a daytime office job.Dink, as his friends call him, was a frontman and cornet player for a band called Whizzy and he even boasts a scar from a wild night at CBGB\u2019s. Band members wrapped themselves up in Bubble Wrap, handed out candy and played a song called \u201cDwarven Funk Rap,\u201d where Dinklage ran around the stage yelling \u201cI\u2019m no dwarf!\u201d\u201cI was pretty angry back then,\u201d he says.He comments on all the hipsters with beards, even though he has one, and all the tall buildings.\u201cIt looks like Miami,\u201d he says, staring out the panoramic window. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve never been to Miami. That\u2019s not the life I live.\u201d (Well, he has explored the Night\u2019s Watch Wall and Meereen, and that\u2019s more impressive.)\u201cIt was very toxic out here then,\u201d he says. \u201cThe conspiracy theory was that they had all these spice factories to cover up the smell of the toxic chemicals. Everything smelled of nutmeg. It was rough going.\u201dTHE 4-foot-5 Dinklage has said his condition, short limbs caused by a genetic mutation, made for a \u201ctricky\u201d adolescence, growing up in Brookside, N.J., the son of an insurance salesman and music teacher, and going to a Catholic prep school full of jocks.When I called his close friend Lena Headey, who plays his conniving, incestuous sister, Cersei, in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d she said that his adolescence \u201cmust have been hideous.\u201d But Dinklage downplays it now.\u201cIt\u2019s called hormones,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why in certain cultures, they send teenagers out into the woods for periods of time.\u201dHe married the theater director Erica Schmidt in 2005 in Vegas. \u201cI was going there for a charity event,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd then while we were there, we just decided to do it. It was a bit lonely. We got a VHS videocassette of the wedding that no one will ever see, that we\u2019ve buried in a box deep beneath the earth\u2019s core.\u201dWhen Dinklage first told his grandmother that he was going to play Tyrion Lannister, she thought he said \u201cinterior banister.\u201d (His other grandmother was \u201csort of a Follies girl\u201d who acted in silent film shorts.) \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has since made him internationally recognizable. And unlike others on the show, Dinklage can\u2019t simply change his hair and clothes and blend in. So he\u2019s a target for every crazy \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d superfan (like me) in addition to those who stare, taunt or touch him for luck \u2014 a superstition about dwarves.The very private and low-key actor doesn\u2019t have a personal publicist, and he\u2019s not on social media. The Internet falsely spread the word that his daughter\u2019s name is Zelig. \u201cI love that Woody Allen movie,\u201d he says, \u201cbut why would you name your child after that character?\u201dWhen he\u2019s out in New York walking with his hound dog and his daughter \u2014 whose name he prefers to keep out of the press \u2014 he\u2019s bombarded with people snapping his picture, sometimes surreptitiously, which irritates him, and sometimes nonchalantly, which surprises him.\u201cThe other day this teenage girl walked right up to me and put her arm around me and took a selfie and said \u2018Thanks\u2019 and just kept walking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was almost forgivable because she saw nothing wrong with it. But if you\u2019re sneaking pictures, you know you\u2019re not doing something great. Oftentimes, they don\u2019t want to meet you; they just want proof that they met you. I was watching that Steve Jobs movie on a plane the other day and I was like, \u2018You started a monster, man.\u2019\u201dA team of mathematicians recently did a network analysis of 107 characters in George Martin\u2019s sprawling epic and declared Tyrion the true protagonist.\u201cTyrion is the character that everyone loves,\u201d says Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays his brother, Jaime Lannister. \u201cI think he\u2019s clearly fighting the just cause. Even when he kills his father, you instantly understand.\u201dDavid Benioff, the other creator and writer, thinks Tyrion has the most modern voice and relatable perspective. \u201cWe all love Jon Snow, but most of us aren\u2019t heroes,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cTyrion is a bit cynical and capable of breaking out of that cynicism.\u201dHe added that there is now \u201ca lot of Peter in Tyrion,\u201d and said they have drawn on his teasing friendships with Headey and Conleth Hill, the Irish actor who plays the eunuch, Lord Varys.When I noted that Tyrion and Varys have a Humphrey Bogart-Claude Rains thing going, Benioff replied, \u201cThat is not accidental.\u201dI asked him if Tyrion, the favorite character of Martin, President Obama, me and most fans, was unkillable.\u201cNo one is immortal,\u201d he replied.Dinklage laughs at that and says of Benioff and Weiss: \u201cOh, I try to keep them in my good graces, those two. Believe me, I keep them filled with liquor and joy.\u201dI mention that the Internet overflows with comments about how sexy he is, to which Dinklage drolly replies, \u201cHey, where were they when I was in high school? Too late, ladies.\u201dHe became the first dwarf to play a romantic lead in a movie when he starred in the 2003 indie hit \u201cThe Station Agent.\u201d Even with Coster-Waldau and Kit Harington (Jon Snow) as competition, Dinklage\u2019s debonair reputation continues to grow.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s adjusting very well to being a sex symbol,\u201d Coster-Waldau said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like any fuss about him.\u201dEmilia Clarke testified: \u201cHis charm is absolutely irresistible. My mom came to the set once. She\u2019s very English. I have never seen that woman blush until I turned around and she was talking to Peter. His wit is quicker than Tyrion\u2019s.\u201dSophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark, seconded that: \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be married to Peter Dinklage onscreen. I wish I was married to Peter Dinklage. He oozes natural sex appeal. Just watching him, I learned how to act with my eyes.\u201dDinklage is a prankster who likes to goose up the mood by shouting out ridiculous things or making cracks right before they call \u201cAction.\u201dHe admits he was surprised by the \u201chuge uproar about Sansa\u2019s character being raped\u201d by her next husband, the loathsome Ramsay Bolton.\u201cYou just love these characters and you don\u2019t want to see anything bad happen to them,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the same people are O.K. with all these prostitutes on the show being killed and raped.\u201dAsked about the anger the series has provoked among some for its treatment of women, Dinklage replies: \u201cI love strong reactions to things in what we do for a living. If it doesn\u2019t boil the blood, especially in this genre, then we\u2019re not doing our jobs.\u201dHe pitched Headey for the role of the sister who despises him, after working with her a decade ago on a failed TV pilot in Canada about a cat-crazy math professor and a messed-up chick. But on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d they turn their tie into an \u201cintimacy of hate,\u201d as Weiss puts it.\u201cHe\u2019s a cool cat, Pete,\u201d Headey told me. \u201cHe\u2019s not immediately warm. I like those people. He has a wicked tongue and is clever and informed. He\u2019s on the other end of the phone if you ever need him. If he doesn\u2019t like you, he doesn\u2019t pretend.\u201dThe two shared an apartment in Belfast, where much of the show is shot on sets constructed near the site where the Titanic was built.At the end of a long, gory day of regicide, patricide, homicide, husband-cide and mistress-cide, Headey and Dinklage went home, poured some wine and watched \u201cProject Runway.\u201d\u201cWell, who doesn\u2019t love Tim Gunn?\u201d Dinklage grins. \u201cMake it work.\u201dHe says he still has trouble pronouncing her character\u2019s name Cer-see instead of Cer-say and ends up dubbing it in postproduction.Dinklage has long said he did not want to be a role model or spokesman for dwarves. (Dwarf is the term he uses, or dwarvy, as an adjective.) He made an exception when he talked about Martin Henderson, a British dwarf who was tossed in a bar, when he accepted his Golden Globe in 2012.Though he refused leprechaun parts early in his career, he now hopes to make a movie about a leprechaun called \u201cO\u2019Lucky Day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very different take on it,\u201d he says.As we leave, I reflexively repeat my standard goodbye line for women and men who are very charming in interviews.\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re a doll.\u201dHe shoots me a look and I freeze.But then he smiles. \u201cI know,\u201d he says, as he saunters off with his backpack.",

        "Text": "Last week, the Santa Fe-based art collective Meow Wolf introduced \u201cThe House of Eternal Return\u201d \u2014 an interactive, multimedia art experience that one of Meow Wolf\u2019s co-founders, Vince Kadlubek, refers to as \u201cimmersive storytelling.\u201d And appropriately for the otherworldly space, created by a team of 135 artists, maestros-of-fantasy like George R. R. Martin and Neil Gaiman attended the opening.Upon arrival, guests are told a magical-yet-brief story about the Seligs, the imagined family around which the backstory revolves. They once occupied the house, and then \u2014 by appearances, rather suddenly \u2014 they left. Visitors are then free to roam the 20,000-square-foot \u201cHouse,\u201d to stitch together the rest of the narrative on their own. Clues range from elements of the big picture \u2014 about the home\u2019s whereabouts, and what happened there \u2014 to the smallest personal details of the former fictional residents. (To create authentic environments in the children\u2019s rooms, artists collaborated with local children over many months.) Needless to say, nothing about this work of art is behind velvet ropes. Hands-on exploring \u2014 call it snooping \u2014 is de rigueur.It\u2019s fitting that even the site of the \u201cHouse,\u201d where a cavernous, abandoned bowling alley originally stood, was afforded in large part by the fruits of human fantasy. In January 2014, Martin \u2014 the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d creator and a Santa Fe resident \u2014 bought the structure, and provided an additional $3 million in renovations, to support the creation of the Meow Wolf Complex and the House of Eternal Return. Part commentary on what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not in an increasingly \u201cvirtual\u201d age, and part good old-fashioned mystery-solving, the \u201cHouse of Eternal Return\u201d is Meow Wolf\u2019s first permanent exhibit. They hope the project will bolster Santa Fe\u2019s reputation as a mecca for young, innovative artists from around the globe.",

        "Text": "Ten\u00eda muchas preguntas para Peter Dinklage.Quer\u00eda saber qu\u00e9 se sent\u00eda ser el primer enano rompecorazones. Me daba curiosidad saber por qu\u00e9 su hija de 4 a\u00f1os se llama Zelig. Y tambi\u00e9n quer\u00eda saber c\u00f3mo era casarse en Las Vegas en secreto.Pero primero le ten\u00eda que preguntar sobre los dragones.\u00a0A pocos d\u00edas del estreno de la sexta temporada, en la que el astuto y perverso Tyrion Lannister estar\u00e1 aliado con la reina de los dragones, Daenerys Targaryen, \u00bffue divertido actuar con los dragones?, \u00bfo eran unas divas temperamentales que mord\u00edan \u23afo incineraban\u23af la escenograf\u00eda?\u201cNo son reales\u201d, me aclar\u00f3 mientras me miraba\u00a0con sus ojos azules, grandes y ca\u00eddos.\u00bfQu\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9? Estoy impactada de que a Dinklage se le salga un spoiler de esta magnitud, pues el grado de sigilo de\u00a0HBO se parece tanto a la CIA que ha llegado a confiscar el celular de los extras y este a\u00f1o se rehus\u00f3 a dar a la prensa episodios con antelaci\u00f3n. (Otro dato menos revelador: HBO planea hacer un piloto de una comedia inspirado en mi libro \u201c\u00bfSon necesarios los hombres?\u201d).\u201cLos dragones solo son una proyecci\u00f3n\u201d, explica Dinklage con su voz melodiosa de bar\u00edtono. \u201cAh, lo que es trabajar con algo que no est\u00e1 ah\u00ed. A veces trabajo con ciertos actores que no est\u00e1n del todo\u00a0presentes. Los chicos del departamento de efectos visuales te ense\u00f1an previsualizaciones, \u201cprevis\u201d. Antes eran guiones gr\u00e1ficos, pero ahora ya los hacen bien en las computadoras y ves toda la escena: te ves\u00a0con los dragones animados antes de que la hagas, para que la tengas en la cabeza. Es divertido. Me gusta\u201d.Esta temporada de \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d ser\u00e1 la primera que vaya m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los libros de George R. R. Martin, como el\u00a0globo terr\u00e1queo de la Edad Media donde marcan los territorios inexplorados con las palabras: \u201cAqu\u00ed hay dragones\u201d.La quinta temporada termin\u00f3 cuando Tyrion se ofreci\u00f3 a ser el Dick Cheney de Daenerys, interpretada por Emilia Clarke, y ayudarla a conquistar y gobernar los Siete Reinos.\u201cNo la puedes comparar con Eleanor Roosevelt, creo\u201d, confiesa Dinklage. \u201cElla es mucho m\u00e1s cool\u201d.Le pregunto acerca del comentario que hizo en Entertainment Weekly sobre que, como en el programa son frecuentes las muertes s\u00fabitas, el par podr\u00eda \u201cdespedirse con fuegos gloriosos, con explosiones, como Bonnie y Clyde\u201d. \u00bfPreferir\u00eda eso al Trono de Hierro?\u201cCreo que deber\u00edan desmantelar el Trono de Hierro\u201d, responde descaradamente. \u201cF\u00fandanlo y d\u00e9nselo a los pobres. Es muy inc\u00f3modo. Le dieron permiso a la reina de Inglaterra para que se sentara en \u00e9l, pero no lo hizo. Pero, sabes, es una se\u00f1ora mayor y, como yo ya me he sentado ah\u00ed, puedo entender por qu\u00e9: est\u00e1 hecho de espadas. A veces tu trasero se queda un poquito atorado\u201d.\u00bfSer\u00e1 que alguna vez piensa en el programa en t\u00e9rminos del mundo pol\u00edtico moderno?\u201c\u00bfCrees que Trump implemente el juicio por combate?\u201d, me pregunta con picard\u00eda.Yo se\u00f1alo el hecho de que tanto Tyrion como Trump se vieron obligados a acallar rumores sobre su hombr\u00eda.\u201cS\u00ed, qu\u00e9 debate tan elegante fue ese, \u00bfno?\u201d, y el actor se r\u00ede. \u201cWow. La vida y la televisi\u00f3n se est\u00e1n convirtiendo en un mismo episodio\u201d.(Dan Weiss, uno de los creadores y escritores de \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d, dice que Trump le recuerda a Hodor, un tonto enorme que responde a todo lo que le dicen con una palabra: su nombre).Estoy sentada con Dinklage, que lleva un chaleco sobre un hoodie\u00a0negro, jeans\u00a0negros, botas Blundstone y la mata de pelo sin cepillar, en un cuarto del muy elegante Hotel Wythe en Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Trae\u00a0la \u00faltima obra autobiogr\u00e1fica de Patti Smith. Sus \u00eddolos son las personas que logran tener estilo sin mucho esfuerzo: Smith, Lou Reed, Tob\u00edas Wolf y Sam Shepard.El actor, de 46 a\u00f1os, menciona que en los noventa, despu\u00e9s de haber ido a Bennington College, vivi\u00f3 a unas cinco cuadras del hotel. En ese entonces intentaba tener \u00e9xito como actor y se manten\u00eda con un trabajo de oficina.Dink, como le dicen sus amigos, era el l\u00edder y cornetista de una banda llamada Whizzy y hasta presume una cicatriz de una noche salvaje en CBGB, el c\u00e9lebre\u00a0club de rock Nueva York. Los integrantes del grupo se envolvieron con papel burbuja, repartieron dulces y tocaron una canci\u00f3n que se llamaba \u201cDwarven Funk Rap\u201d, mientras Dinklage corr\u00eda por el escenario gritando: \u201c\u00a1No soy ning\u00fan enano!\u201d.Dinklage, que mide 1,37 metro ha dicho que su condici\u00f3n, tener las extremidades cortas debido a una mutaci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica, hizo que su adolescencia fuera \u201ccomplicada\u201d. Creci\u00f3 en Brookside, Nueva Jersey \u2014es hijo de un vendedor de seguros y de una maestra de m\u00fasica\u2014 y asisti\u00f3 a una escuela\u00a0cat\u00f3lica llena de deportistas.En 2005 se cas\u00f3 con la directora de teatro Erica Schmidt en Las Vegas. \u201cFui ah\u00ed para un evento de beneficencia\u201d, recuerda. \u201cY ya que est\u00e1bamos ah\u00ed, decidimos hacerlo. Fue un poco solitario. Tenemos un video\u00a0en VHS de la boda que nadie nunca ver\u00e1; lo enterramos dentro de una caja en lo profundo, muy por debajo del coraz\u00f3n de la tierra\u201d.Su papel en\u00a0\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d le ha dado reconocimiento mundial. Y a diferencia de otros en la serie, para Dinklage es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil pasar desapercibido, as\u00ed que es el blanco de todos los admiradores\u00a0del programa (como yo), y de todos\u00a0que de por s\u00ed se le quedan viendo, lo molestan o lo tocan para tener buena suerte, una superstici\u00f3n sobre los enanos.Este actor, que es muy reservado y de bajo perfil, no tiene un publicista ni est\u00e1 en redes sociales. En internet corri\u00f3 el rumor sin fundamentos de que su hija se llamaba Zelig. \u201cMe encanta esa pel\u00edcula de Woody Allen\u201d, confiesa, \u201cpero, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 le pondr\u00eda a mi hija el nombre de ese personaje?\u201d.Cuando est\u00e1 en Nueva York de paseo con su sabueso y su hija, cuyo nombre prefiere no mencionar a la prensa, hay\u00a0personas que le toman fotos, a veces de manera subrepticia, lo cual lo irrita, y a veces sin verg\u00fcenza alguna, lo cual le sorprende.\u201cEl otro d\u00eda esta adolescente llega y pone su brazo en mi hombro y se toma una selfie. Me dio las gracias y sigui\u00f3 su camino\u201d, cuenta. \u201cCasi hasta la perdonaba porque ella no le vio nada de malo.\u00a0En cambio si tomas fotos a escondidas, sabes que no est\u00e1s haciendo algo bueno. Muchas veces ni quieren conocerte, solo quieren la prueba de que te conocieron. El otro d\u00eda estaba viendo la pel\u00edcula de Steve Jobs en un avi\u00f3n y pens\u00e9: \u2018Creaste un monstruo, amigo\u2019\u201d.Hace poco un equipo de matem\u00e1ticos hizo un an\u00e1lisis de redes sobre 107 personajes de la gran \u00e9pica de George Martin y declar\u00f3 a Tyrion el verdadero protagonista.\u201cTyrion es el personaje al que todos quieren\u201d, explic\u00f3 Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, que interpreta a su hermano, Jamie Lannister. \u201cCreo que es obvio que \u00e9l est\u00e1 del lado de los buenos. Hasta cuando mata a su padre, inmediatamente entiendes por qu\u00e9\u201d.David Benioff, el otro creador y escritor, piensa que la voz de Tyrion es la m\u00e1s moderna y tiene la perspectiva con la que es m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil empatizar. \u201cTodos queremos a Jon Snow, pero la mayor\u00eda de nosotros no somos h\u00e9roes\u201d, sostuvo Benioff. \u201cTyrion es un poco c\u00ednico, aunque tambi\u00e9n es capaz de dejar de lado ese cinismo\u201d.Le pregunt\u00e9 si Tyrion, el personaje favorito de Martin, del Presidente Obama, de la mayor\u00eda de los admiradores y m\u00edo, era imposible de matar.\u201cNadie es inmortal\u201d, replic\u00f3.Dinklage se r\u00ede de eso y dice de Benioff y Weiss: \u201cUy, intento ser agradable con\u00a0esos dos. Cr\u00e9eme, los consiento con mucho licor y alegr\u00eda\u201d.Le digo que el internet se desborda con comentarios sobre lo sexy que es, a lo cual responde de manera jovial: \u201cA ver, \u00bfd\u00f3nde estaban cuando yo iba a la escuela? Demasiado tarde, se\u00f1oritas\u201d.Incluso con Coster-Waldau y Kit Harrington (Jon Snow) como competencia, la reputaci\u00f3n de Dinklage como un donju\u00e1n sigue creciendo.\u201cCreo que no se ha hecho mucho a la idea de ser un s\u00edmbolo sexual\u201d, dijo Coster-Waldau. \u201cNo le gusta llamar la atenci\u00f3n\u201d.Emilia Clarke testific\u00f3: \u201cSu encanto es absolutamente irresistible. Una vez, mi mam\u00e1, que es muy inglesa, fue al set. Nunca hab\u00eda visto a esa mujer sonrojarse, hasta que volteo y veo que est\u00e1 hablando con Peter. Su ingenio es m\u00e1s agudo que el de Tyrion\u201d.Sophie Turner, quien interpreta a Sansa Stark, concuerda: \u201cTengo suerte de estar casada con Peter Dinklage en la serie. Ojal\u00e1 estuviera casada con \u00e9l de verdad. Tiene\u00a0un atractivo sexual innato. Nada m\u00e1s con verlo aprend\u00ed a actuar con mis ojos\u201d.Dinklage es un bromista al que le gusta gritar cosas rid\u00edculas o hacer chistes justo antes de que griten \u201c\u00a1Acci\u00f3n!\u201d.Al preguntar sobre el descontento que ha creado el programa por su forma de tratar a las mujeres, Dinklage responde: \u201cMe encantan las reacciones fuertes. Si no logramos que les hierva la sangre, sobre todo en este g\u00e9nero, entonces no estamos cumpliendo con nuestro deber\u201d.Desde hace mucho Dinklage ha dicho que no quiere convertirse en un vocero o modelo a seguir de los enanos. (\u00c9l usa la palabra enano). Sin embargo, hizo una excepci\u00f3n cuando recibi\u00f3 el Globo de Oro en el 2012 y habl\u00f3 de Martin Henderson, el enano ingl\u00e9s al que lanzaron al aire en un bar.Aunque al empezar su carrera rechazaba papeles de duende, ahora desea hacer una pel\u00edcula sobre un duende llamada \u201cO\u2019Lucky Day\u201d. \u201cTiene una perspectiva muy diferente al respecto\u201d, aclara.Ya al irnos, sin pensarlo, repito mi frase de despedida que uso tanto para hombres como mujeres que fueron encantadores en la entrevista.\u201cGracias, eres todo un mu\u00f1eco\u201d, le digo.Me echa una mirada que me deja helada.Pero despu\u00e9s sonr\u00ede. \u201cYo s\u00e9\u201d, me responde.",

        "Text": "Normally, you\u2019d be confused. Why would HBO lower the curtain on Season 5 of \u201cGirls\u201d with two episodes on Sunday rather than the usual one at a time? Why not give the show\u2019s 10 episodes a full 10 weeks? But there are the mysteries. Then there are the realities.And the presumable reality is that decks needed clearing and hatches needed battening for next weekend\u2019s simultaneous resumption of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d \u2014 and the Saturday unveiling of whatever this ultra-top-secret Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cLemonade\u201d thing is supposed to be.So Sunday\u2019s economy-size \u201cGirls\u201d finale points to the national indifference that\u2019s accrued around a show whose fealty to discomfort, poor choices and social cannibalism, which felt new in 2012, are now just part of television\u2019s oxygen. In the last two seasons, the show\u2019s senses of satire and pathos are stronger and more pungent than ever: But it\u2019s true. Funny narcissists are indeed easy to come by (even on HBO). Perhaps instead you\u2019re watching \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d \u201cVeep\u201d \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cTogetherness\u201d \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst.\u201dAnd \u201cGirls\u201d didn\u2019t invent them. There they were, for instance, on \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201c30 Rock.\u201dBut \u201cGirls\u201d keeps finding ways of dramatizing its satire so that it doesn\u2019t always seem satirical. Few shows better explore the complications of personality and behavior. Even if it doesn\u2019t appear as robust, refined and specific an achievement as, say, \u201cTransparent,\u201d the show still has the confidence to jump along a tightrope of displeasure.[ Has \u201cGirls\u201d gotten better? Read our discussion. ]The show\u2019s self-obsessives, ringmastered by its chief protagonist, Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham), pinball off one another, going from friends to lovers to frenemies. What set the show apart this year \u2014 from both its previous seasons and most of its peers \u2014 is the use of the space, place, framing, allusion and mood to house that narcissism. Bad manners are met with mannerism. Shoshanna\u2019s first adult job landed her in Tokyo and, for a few episodes, the show went with her. Her intoxication with the culture \u2014 without her Japanese pals losing sight of her foreignness \u2014 felt like a gentle rebuke of the incurious insularity of a movie like \u201cLost in Translation.\u201d She wasn\u2019t a citizen. Nor was she a tourist.This season\u2019s seventh episode was particularly handsome. Written by Sarah Heyward and directed by Richard Shepard, it turned the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese into a piece of immersive theater staged inside and around a stately apartment complex, which was meant to evoke the building near where Genovese was killed, while her neighbors went about their business.The killing inspired decades of social-science research; the show used the case as an ideal test for the characters\u2019 own emotional nearsightedness. (\u201cHello Kitty\u201d is the episode\u2019s title.) Hannah enters the building lobby mid-argument with her current boyfriend, Fran (Jake Lacy), and leaves devastated that her ex, Adam (Adam Driver), might be sleeping with one of her best friends, Jessa (Jemima Kirke).As usual, the comedy comes, in part, from Hannah\u2019s obnoxious rebellion against propriety, which tends to be represented by poor Ray (Alex Karpovsky). His morality, civic engagement, loyalty and earnestness (culturally, he\u2019s a generation older) are constantly disrupted, compromised and exploited by everyone else. This time he just wants to lose himself in some theater and no one will let him.The small silences in this episode are rich and absorptive. They\u2019re too much, though, for Hannah, who keeps breaking them to muse about the artifice of it all. When her friend Marnie (Allison Williams) enters one apartment, newly single and almost radioactively aglow, she doubles the obliviousness. It\u2019s unclear she even knows she\u2019s at a play.They\u2019re there to see Adam perform as half of a squabbling married couple, but by the time the play reaches its grisly climax, none of these people are really paying attention. Adam looked across the courtyard at Jessa, who\u2019s vamping at him on a fire escape, while Hannah watches them both in disbelief. They ignore the screams and barely notice the amateurish plaster statues that stand in for the victim and her killer. There\u2019s just Brenda Lee misting up the soundtrack.Basically, a re-enacted crime loses out to a figurative one. It\u2019s one of the show\u2019s most sophisticated and most intricately filmed gags about selfishness. The camera glides toward windows. It cranes downs at the plaster stand-ins. It oscillates from Jessa to Adam to Hannah. Perhaps you think about \u201cRear Window,\u201d \u201cMonsieur Hire,\u201d \u201cStakeout\u201d or any other movie involving voyeurism, danger and a little melodrama. And the atmosphere is so rich you can practically feel the balm of warm spring air. But Hannah and Marnie peel off to commiserate. And by the time you see these two spread out on somebody\u2019s bed, they\u2019ve cast themselves in their own sitcom: \u201cThe Sorrow and the Self-Pity.\u201dBut the show manages to maintain the gravity of both transgressions: an ambitious if seemingly dumb take on real tragedy and the tragedy that Hannah thinks is her life. It\u2019s a kicky, poignant half-hour of television \u2014 half of which is spent elsewhere at a Manhattan party, featuring Hannah\u2019s roommate, Elijah (Andrew Rannells), who is trying to hold his own among greasy gay celebrities. Each plot warranted its own episode, but that was \u201cGirls\u201d this year: so many good ideas, so little space to unfurl them.There were moments during the series\u2019 underrated fourth season when, between Hannah\u2019s damningly indulgent stint at the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop and the invention of a carnivorous art-monster named Mimi-Rose (Gillian Jacobs), the show looked as if it had found its groove as a creative-class farce. This fifth season ended on a not-dissimilar note, after Hannah runs into Tally (Jenny Slate), a college classmate, with a dark cloud of hair, who has become a literary star. She\u2019s like Bizzaro Hannah: Her narcissism doesn\u2019t repel success; it vacuums it up.Tally encourages Hannah to steal a guy\u2019s unlocked bike (it\u2019s a sign, Tally says), and through two montages \u2014 set first to Vanity Fare then to Nicki Minaj and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 they ride to Williamsburg, smoke a joint on Tally\u2019s bed, and dance in her apartment. And for half an episode, as Tally and Hannah pedal and puff, \u201cGirls\u201d is no longer \u201cGirls.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cBroad City.\u201dOn that show, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson mount a perfectly calibrated celebration of millennial obnoxiousness, while also nailing the ridiculousness of 21st-century consumer culture. The two shows have unruly young women and Brooklyn in common. That\u2019s about it. But the way Ms. Slate is made to look resembles \u2014 passingly, cartoonishly \u2014 Ms. Glazer. These scenes between Ms. Slate and Ms. Dunham suggest a lunatic road not taken. \u201cGirls\u201d has some great slapstick. But it\u2019s bending toward maturity that \u201cBroad City\u201d doesn\u2019t care about.When it started, \u201cGirls\u201d was received as an anthem for entitled white women. Detractors had a field day with Ms. Dunham, who created this show and has written and directed much of it, for privileging privilege, as if she couldn\u2019t be aspiring to the withering heights of Luis Bu\u00f1uel or Carrie Fisher.Through 52 episodes of television \u2014 some of them, like that Kitty Genovese episode, marvelous \u2014 \u201cGirls\u201d has never stopped looking for the grander, harsher psychological picture. It\u2019s never stopped looking for tough laughs. It fights real-life American absurdity with its own version of it, as it does in the final episode of the season, in which Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet, a crayon turning at last into a scalpel) rebrands Ray\u2019s coffee shop as a hipster-free haven for people who actually work \u2014 that is, for \u201cadults,\u201d in other words.But in its highest gear, the show peerlessly vanishes the line between sociocultural satire and mental instability, between send up and crack up.That business with Hannah, Adam and Jessa closes the season with an unnerving cliffhanger. Hannah performs her pain for the storytellers\u2019 radio hour \u201cThe Moth,\u201d which obviously she takes to like a you-know-what to a flame. The night\u2019s theme is jealousy. In her tale, she proves she\u2019s overcome it by delivering a peace offering in the form of a fruit basket. But the story deepens and darkens a deranged argument that took place a few minutes earlier. Suddenly, Hannah\u2019s narcissism seems terroristic. Her personality disorder has the power to disorder other people\u2019s personalities. Maybe, she\u2019s the disorder.One of the last shots hovers about a demolished living room. But it\u2019s not exactly a cliffhanger for the show\u2019s next and final season. It\u2019s a cliff-edged view of the wreckage in the canyon. Plus, there\u2019s something about the way the camera lingers on the basket outside the door that makes Hannah\u2019s offering seem more than a gift. It looks like a bomb.",

        "Publication": "New York Times",
        "Text": "The actors in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the epic fantasy series featuring story lines about civil war and banishment, are using the enormous popularity of their HBO series to raise money for real-life victims of conflict and exile.Beginning Monday, public service announcements and videos featuring the show\u2019s actors will appear urging support for the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian relief organization that aids refugees. The ads will appear online exclusively, including on the charity\u2019s microsite, YouTube and social media platforms.The campaign will run through the series\u2019s sixth season, which begins April 24, with the goal of raising $1 million. The organization is tapping into a significant audience: The trailer for the coming season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was viewed 32 million times within 24 hours of being posted online on Tuesday.The campaign will also run on the fund-raising platform Omaze.com, where, for a minimum $10 donation to the International Rescue Committee, donors can enter to win two tickets to the season premiere. Other items, such as T-shirts, will be available for certain donation amounts.The strategies of tapping stars, raffling off celebrity-related experiences and targeting ads at specific groups reflect the current direction of cause-related advertising \u2014 and the ways that nonprofit groups try to differentiate their causes from others vying for attention.\u201cIt brings a fictional story of displacement and conflict to a real-life one and hopes viewers will be prompted to donate,\u201d said Katherina Rosqueta, executive director of the Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd it\u2019s bringing the cause to the audience, rather than the audience to the cause.\u201dThe first public service announcement is straightforward: It shows actors from the series speaking individually, starting with Lena Headey (who plays Cersei Lannister). She says directly to the camera, \u201cMass exodus: Millions on the move, escaping war, famine and destruction.\u201d\u201cThis is no fiction,\u201d DeObia Oparei (Areo Hotah) says next. \u201cNo fantasy.\u201d Others chime in: \u201cSixty million people are displaced worldwide.\u201d \u201cReal people, now on the most dangerous journey of all.\u201d They note that in Syria alone, half the population has fled their homes. The actors then talk about the work of the International Rescue Committee and urge viewers to \u201crise up\u201d and donate with the tag line \u201cRescue has no boundaries.\u201dThe organization and the show were a good fit for several reasons, said David Miliband, president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee. Many of the actors are European and feel a close connection to the refugee crisis; the series is also filmed throughout Europe.It also helped that Mr. Miliband and Richard Plepler, chairman and chief executive of HBO, know each other.\u201cWhen I heard of the challenges of the I.R.C., I had lunch with him and told him that we\u2019re here to help,\u201d Mr. Plepler said.HBO\u2019s creative services team filmed the public service announcement, and Omaze also plans to release three videos for its site that will take a lighter tone: The first is called \u201cSwords vs. Metal Bands.\u201d The campaign will include another public service announcement and related content later in the season, to be released on social media and the International Rescue Committee\u2019s website.Cause-marketing can backfire, however. When KFC partnered with the Susan G. Komen Foundation, which raises money for breast cancer research, the company was criticized for \u201cpinkwashing\u201d because eating deep-fried chicken can contribute to obesity, and obesity has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.Even Toms, the shoe company known for its involvement in good causes, received pushback on its \u201cOne for One\u201d campaign \u2014 donating a pair of shoes to children around the world for every pair bought. Critics said such donations could undercut local shoe sellers, and make people reliant on outside aid.Steve McKee, president of the ad agency McKee, Wallwork and Company, who has written about cause-related advertising, emphasized that he was not familiar with the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d campaign, but noted that \u201cif the cause is controversial in any way \u2014 if there are two legitimate sides to the issue \u2014 you\u2019re really playing with fire. The trust you build with some may be lost with others.\u201dThe first \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d public service announcement avoids politics; it mentions, for example, the thousands of refugees granted safe haven in the United States, but not the debate about whether countries, including the United States, are accepting enough or too many refugees.The show is also known for its depiction of violence, and some might wonder if it is the right vehicle to comment about the effects of real-life violence.Mr. Plepler, the HBO chairman, dismissed such a concern.\u201cAnyone who draws the connection between fantasy and the tragedy befalling the world is straining credulity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling attention to a global tragedy. The first step is to get people in a crowded world to pay attention, and it sometimes helps to have celebrities raise the issue.\u201dAnd it is the opportunity to mingle with a favorite celebrity, or the cast of a favorite show, that brings in the money. Ryan Cummins, a co-founder of Omaze \u2014 which receives 20 percent of all net donations \u2014 says an average fund-raiser on its site pulls in from $250,000 to $1 million. For its campaign with the Disney and Lucasfilm charity Star Wars: Force for Change, the prize was an appearance in \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d It raised over $4.2 million.Such games and giveaways can seem out of place when juxtaposed with the very serious needs being addressed, said Alexandra Budabin, an adjunct professor of political science at the University of Dayton who studies the intersection of celebrities and humanitarian work. But, she added, if the popularity of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d could be translated into humanitarian help, then \u201cit does seem like in this case everyone wins. All\u2019s fair in trying to raise money, and trying to educate a population who might not otherwise be educated about this issue.\u201d",

        "Publication": "CNN",
        "Text": "Warning! The following story contains spoilers from the previous seasons of \"Game of Thrones.\" (CNN)Winter has come, and spring -- and more specifically April 25 -- is just around the corner. Which, for \"Game of Thrones\" fans, means only one thing -- a new season of HBO's hit dragons-and-daggers fantasy series is coming.  As a grisly Valentine's Day treat, HBO released a new, short teaser trailer for season 6, which, if the new content is any guide, will be a bleak affair. The short trailer opens with the disembodied faces of three of \"Game of Thrones'\" bygone characters and members of the Stark family: Eddard; Catelyn and Rob, in the crypt of the House of Black and White. They're followed by the reviled (and also murdered) King Joffrey, and Jon Snow, whose apparent betrayal and stabbing left him for dead at the end of last season. In season 5 another Stark, Arya, is apprenticed to the Faceless Men, a shadowy assassins' guild, which magically uses the faces of the dead in their disguises. The camera pans down to the faces of two other characters, last seen alive: Tyrion Lannister and Arya Stark.   It's uncertain if the appearance of characters like Arya and Tyrion in the Faceless Men's head collection mean that this season will be extra-bloody, or if it's just another riff on the show's \"all men must die\" motto.   Sneak peekLast week, HBO fed eager fans another morsel in the form of the first stills from the new season, with production photos showing some of the series' best-loved (and loathed) characters, including a white-eyed Arya Stark, blinded as punishment in the closing scenes of season 5. The eagerly-awaited sixth season of the multiple Emmy-winning show navigates uncharted waters -- for the first time its interweaving plots will move ahead of its source material ---  the wildly successful series of novels by author George R.R. Martin. His sixth book, \"The Winds of Winter,\" has been repeatedly delayed, putting fans through torture worthy of one of his more sadistic characters. Neck and neckThe catching-up of show to books will put fans of both on an even footing for the first time, with book readers unable to count on their prior knowledge to anticipate some of the series' more shocking upcoming twists. Book readers had previously been able to mentally prepare for shocks like the Red Wedding, or the outcome of the epic duel between Oberyn Martell and the Mountain. While the stills confirm the return of many fan favorites, including Arya, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, there is at least one notable absence -- Jon Snow, last seen apparently bleeding out in the snow, betrayed by his own men. The fanbase has since speculated wildly upon his fate, but his appearance in a short teaser trailer released December seems to suggest rumors of his demise were greatly exaggerated. Plot developmentsThe images show a glimpse of what might lie ahead for the show. Shots of Jaime with his twin sister -- and lover -- Cersei point to a reunion between the two. It's unlikely to be a happy one, however, as he is returning from Dorne with their dead daughter's corpse. The return of Yara Greyjoy and her father Balon gives book fans hope that a story arc previously spelled out in Martin's last two books, \"A Feast for Crows\" and \"A Dance with Dragons,\" involving their seafaring family, may feature more prominently in season 6. Another intriguing development that might be gleaned from the stills is the sight of Bran Stark apparently standing unaided, a first since he became paralyzed early on in the show's first season. ",

It's Friday, and here are the 5 things you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.1. Democratic debateNow that was a debate! Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both consider New York home turf. So they said fuhgeddaboudit to the niceness and tried to rip each other to shreds, while a rowdy crowd cheered and hissed. Uncle Bernie said he doubts Hillz has the right stuff for the job (the credibility argument). She said he's unyielding in his pie-in-the-sky proposals (the pragmatism argument). Missed the battle in the Big Apple? Here's a reality check on what they said, here's six takeaways and here's the whole thing in GIFs.2. North KoreaCue the sad trombone. North Korea tried to fire a missile off of its eastern coast early this morning. FAIL! It might have been an intermediate-range missile, but South Korea's military is still checking that out. Oh, and the test happened on the Day of the Sun, the birthday of North Korea's founder. Some birthday gift.3. Japan earthquakeSearch crews are out digging through the rubble of collapsed buildings after a massive quake hit Japan's Kyushu island yesterday. It killed at least nine people and triggered landslides, ripped up roads and even derailed a bullet train. And the worst isn't over. \"This is an earthquake that is going to shake for a long time,\" says our meteorologist Chad Myers. Which could mean more building collapses. Japan sits along the Ring of Fire and so, is no stranger to calamitous quakes. 4. Manson killingsYou know what they say about If at first, you don't succeed...The 19th try might be the one for Leslie Van Houten, who's a step closer to freedom after a California parole board panel said she should be released. Van Houten was a follower of killer Charles Manson and was convicted of murdering supermarket exec Leno Labianca and his wife in 1969 with other members of the cult. But the release isn't a done deal. The full Board of Parole Hearings has to sign off on it. So does Gov. Jerry Brown.5. Live-streamed attackThere's no end to people's depravity, is there. A woman in Ohio's been charged with live-streaming the rape of a friend. Cops say Marina Alexeevna Lonina used Periscope to webcast while a man raped her friend. Lonin will be arraigned later today.

        "Publication": "CNN",
        "Text": " (CNN)It was a good night for vice presidents, transgender women, cranky New Englanders and the inhabitants of a mythical world called Westeros. And it was a great night for HBO.After five seasons HBO's epic \"Game of Thrones\" won its first best-drama award Sunday night at the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, besting the final season of four-time winner \"Mad Men\" in a mild upset. The sprawling medieval fantasy show also won Emmys on Sunday for writing, directing and for supporting actor Peter Dinklage, who plays the scorned scion of a powerful family who is forced to survive by his wits. In total, \"Thrones\" won 12 Emmys in 2015, the most ever by a series in a single year.5 top moments from the Emmy AwardsIn the comedy category, HBO's \"Veep\" finally broke the stranglehold of sitcom powerhouse \"Modern Family,\" which had won the top Emmy for the past five years. \"Veep's\" Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her fourth straight Emmy for her starring turn in the show, about an underestimated female vice-president who nevertheless ascends to the Oval Office. Her castmate Tony Hale won best supporting actor in a comedy series for playing her loyal political aide, and the show also won a writing award.Combined, HBO won 14 Emmys on Sunday -- more than all the other networks and streaming services combined (HBO is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN).But rival networks still claimed a few other top awards.After eight tries, Jon Hamm finally won his first Emmy for his now-iconic role as the hard-drinking, womanizing Don Draper on \"Mad Men,\" which finished its triumphant run last spring on AMC. The actor, who completed a stint in rehab last spring and recently split with longtime girlfriend Jennifer Westfeldt, showed gratitude in a heartfelt acceptance speech. \"There's been a mistake, clearly,\" Hamm said, giving credit to his fellow nominees. \"It's impossible to be named with all of those extraordinary gentlemen.\"Moments earlier, Viola Davis made history by becoming the first African American woman to win an Emmy for best actress in a drama series when she was honored for her work as a high-powered defense attorney in ABC's \"How to Get Away with Murder.\"In an emotional acceptance speech of her own, Davis quoted African-American abolitionist Harriet Tubman and alluded to the dearth of strong roles for minority actresses on TV and movies.\"The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity,\" she said. \"You cannot win an Emmy for roles that are simply not there.\"Davis was one of several pioneering actors honored Sunday night. Actor Jeffrey Tambor won best actor in a comedy for Amazon's groundbreaking \"Transparent,\" about a middle-aged dad who transitions to life as a woman. Tambor, who had been nominated for six prior Emmys but had never won, dedicated his award to the transgender community.\"Thank you for your courage. Thank you for your stories. Thank you for your inspiration,\" he said.His award came after Jill Soloway won an Emmy for writing and directing \"Transparent,\" which debuted at a time of new visibility for transgender Americans such as Caitlyn Jenner. In accepting the award, Soloway noted that despite recent gains, many transgender people still face discrimination and violence.\"We don't have a trans tipping point yet,\" she said. \"We have a trans civil rights problem.\"Emmy Awards 2015: The complete winners listBut the night's biggest winner may have been \"Olive Kitteridge,\" the acclaimed HBO miniseries about 25 years in the life of an acerbic, retired schoolteacher in a seemingly placid Maine town. Based on the Pulitzer-winning novel by Elizabeth Strout, \"Kitteridge\" is the type of prestige project that seems to win awards annually for HBO.It took home Emmys for best limited series and every other award in its category: best actress (Frances McDormand, who played the title character), best actor (Richard Jenkins, her kindly on-screen husband) and best supporting actor (Bill Murray, who didn't show up to claim his award, unfortunately). \"Kitteridge\" director Lisa Cholodenko and screenwriter Jane Anderson also were honored.Earlier, actress Allison Janney won best supporting actress in a comedy for her role in \"Mom,\" in which she plays the overbearing mother of a young adult daughter played by Anna Faris. It was Janney's seventh Emmy; she won four for \"The West Wing\" alone.The award was presented by Amy Poehler and the ever-provocative Amy Schumer, who quipped, \"Let's not forget what this night is really about -- celebrating hilarious women and letting the Internet weigh in on who looks the worst.\"Schumer won an Emmy for best variety sketch series for her Comedy Central show, \"Inside Amy Schumer,\" which tackles such hot-button topics as misogyny and female sexuality. \"This show fights for what we believe in,\" Schumer said.It was also a good night for retiring fake-newsman Jon Stewart, whose \"The Daily Show\" won Emmys for best variety talk series and for its director, Chuck O'Neill. Stewart stepped down in August after 16 years and will be succeeded as \"Daily Show\" host later this month by Trevor Noah.The Emmys show opened with host Andy Samberg in a video that poked fun at TV's overabundance of buzzed-about shows. After being mocked by friends for not keeping up with popular new series, Samberg locks himself in a bunker and watches nothing but TV for a year until he emerges, hairy and wild-eyed, to annoy everyone around him.Samberg then did a brief monologue in which he cracked jokes about diversity in Hollywood, Paula Deen on \"Dancing With the Stars\" and -- perhaps inevitably -- presidential candidate Donald Trump.\"Donald Trump is running for president, to the delight of uncles everywhere,\" Samberg said. \"I've got to say, sure Donald Trump seems racist.\"During Sunday's three-hour show the Television Academy handed out awards in 25 categories, culminating with the night's two biggest prizes: outstanding comedy and drama series. For those keeping score, HBO led all networks with 126 nominations. Far behind in second was ABC with 42, followed by CBS and NBC with 41 each. The Television Academy announced new rules this year that allows all 15,000 academy members, not just smaller groups, to vote for awards -- a change some observers believe benefited shows with large fan bases, such as \"Game of Thrones.\"",

        "Text": "Warning: Spoilers ahead for Sunday's Game of Thrones season finale, \"Mother's Mercy.\" (The Hollywood Reporter)Game of Thrones' season five finale shook up the game in a big way.The field of contenders for the Iron Throne has been whittled down, and fan favorite Jon Snow's (Kit Harington) watch has ended. The series is known for major shakeups, from Eddard Stark's (Sean Bean) death in season one to last year's finale murder of Tywin (Charles Dance). Sunday's finale leaves the field of contenders in more disarray than ever \u2014 and presents many key questions for season six.Who is still competing for the throne?Stannis (Stephen Dillane) is dead. Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) is captured and effectively sidelined for the time being.That leaves Roose (Michael McElhatton) and Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) as frontrunners. They have just won a great victory over Stannis, the latest victory in the sadistic father-son duo's rise. The Lannisters remain power, but with Cersei (Lena Headey) on trial and Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman) a green boy-king on the throne, things are not looking good for them. They've also lost their princess Myrcella (Nell Tiger Free) and will have to deal with the fallout from that tragedy, which could potentially spark war with Dorne. Things have never looked worse for the Lannisters. See more 'Game of Thrones': 25 Best QuotesThere's also the Tyrells. While members of the younger generation Margaery (Natalie Dormer) and Loras (Finn Jones) are imprisoned, savvy grandmother Olenna (Diana Rigg) has formed an alliance with Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen), who helped her get Cersei imprisoned. The wealthy Tyrells, whose homeland, High Garden, is already providing King's Landing with most of its food, makes them popular among the people. They could make a legitimate run for the Iron Throne. Who will defend against the Night's King?With Jon gone, there are few people alive who know what the Night's King is capable of. The Night's Watch does not subscribe to Jon's idea that allying itself with the Wildlings is a good idea. And so the battle against the White Walkers seems more hopeless than ever with both Stannis and Jon gone, as they were the only non-Wildlings who really understood the threat. Perhaps Sam (John Bradley) can pick up the anti-White Walker mantle.Where will Sansa and Theon go?It's difficult to predict what will happen to Sansa (Sophie Turner) and Theon (Alfie Allen). In excerpts from George R.R. Martin's upcoming Winds of Winter, Theon and Jeyne Poole, who (instead of Sansa had posed as Arya and married married Ramsay) escaped together and made it to Stannis' camp. Stannis sent Jeyne to The Wall to be reunited with her \"brother\" Jon. Could the series see Sansa and Theon head to The Wall? It seems that would be the logical place to go, unless they could travel to Theon's homeland, The Iron Islands. Sansa now knows her brothers are alive, so she would likely attempt to find them, if she learns they went north of The Wall.Read more: Game of Thrones' director on exiting star's last day, Cersei's \"excruciating\" walkWill Daenerys be rescued?It would be such a pity if Daenerys went the way of Jon Snow and didn't survive long enough to ride her dragons into Westeros. But fans also assumed the mystery of Jon Snow's true mother meant that he would survive until that revelation happened. Is it possible Jorah (Iain Glen) and Daario (Michiel Huisman) could use Daenerys remaining dragons to track her? Is Meereen in good hands?Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson), Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) are now in charge of Meereen while the Mother of Dragons is away. This storyline has a lot of potential, as Grey Worm and Missandei are two of the series legitimate \"good guys.\" Tyrion has real acumen for ruling. The question is ... will the terrorist-infested city accept them?See more: 'Game of Thrones'' most gruesome deathsWhat's next for Arya?Arya is now blind, after ignoring the training of the Faceless Men and killing Meryn Trant (Ian Beattie) for personal reasons. With nowhere else to go, she will presumably complete her training. If that's the case, she would truly need to let go of her identity (no more vowing to kill Cersei and her other enemies).Don't forget about BranBran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and Hodor (Kristian Nairn) sat out season five, but are expected to return for season six. When viewers last saw them, they met a member of The Children, an ancient race who live beyond the Wall. They also finally made it to the three-eyed crow, and presumably have spent the last year training. When Bran returns to the show, he might have some even more impressive powers with him.For more from the finale, check out our interview with director David Nutter here, read about the finale's big developments here and revisit the season's most shocking scenes.See the original story at The Hollywood Reporter's website. \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter.

On Sunday, tracker sites TorrentFreak and Excipio released data revealing which television series and films were the most popular for piracy in 2015.  \"Game of Thrones\" was named as 2015's \"most pirated TV show\" on the web, with an estimated 14.4 million people downloading season five's finale \"Mother's Mercy\" via BitTorrent, almost double the estimated amount of its U.S. TV viewers.  \"Game of Thrones\" has won the crown for four years running now, according to data accumulated by the piracy tracking site, TorrentFreak, with 2015's season finale seeing more than half of its downloads in the first week after the episode aired.  2015's figure surpasses 2014's winner, \"Game of Thrones\"' season four finale, which was downloaded 8.1 million times illegally via BitTorrent.  \"The Walking Dead\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\" came in second and third for piracy \u2014 as they did in 2014 \u2014 with their most popular episodes. Newcomers \"Mr. Robot\" and \"Supergirl\" made an entrance into the Top 10, having both aired their debut series in 2015.  \"The results show that TV shows remain very popular among pirates all around the world,\" Ernesto Van der Sar, TorrentFreak's founder and editor-in-chief, told CNBC via email.  \"Game of Thrones in particular has a large following, which may in part be due to the fact that people are not willing (or can't) pay for a subscription.\"  Related: Online Piracy, Ad Fraud Cost U.S. Media Firms $8.2B a Year: Report  The download numbers estimated by the piracy tracker used several sources, however, online streaming and downloads for file-hosting services weren't included, with the firm adding that total piracy numbers overall would be \"significantly higher.\"  Read More: Got 'Game'? This is the most pirated TV show  2014 blockbusters and some of 2015's highest grossing films dominated this year's most pirated films.  Three of 2015's most popular films \u2014 all of which grossed over $1 billion worldwide \u2014 were a favorite among online torrent users: \"Furious 7\" (44.8 million), \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" (41.6 million), and \"Jurassic World\" (36.9 million).  Christopher Nolan's 2014 sci-fi epic \"Interstellar\" was named as 2015's most pirated film, with over 46.7 million downloads, according to data by piracy tracking firm Excipio, sent to CNBC via email.  Overall, the data show that movies that performed well in the domestic and international box offices in 2015 were also popular with torrent users.  In the top 14, up to four films from 2014 featured in the list, all of which were released in theaters from November 2014 onward.  As Excipio's data was gathered from January 1 to December 25 2015, 2014 movies that came out late had more time to generate popularity online, with all the top 14 having been released in the summer of 2015, or before.  More from CNBC: 'The Wolf of Wall Street' trumps 'Frozen' for piracy  When comparing this data to Excipio's 2014 list, illegal downloading is evidently on the rise.  In 2014, Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" was crowned as the year's most illegally downloaded film, with 30 million downloads, which compared to 2015's list wouldn't even make the top 10.  This most pirated films of 2015 was first reported by Variety.  Disclosure: CNBC's parent Comcast owns Universal Pictures and NBC. ",

        "Publication": "NBC",
        "Text": " Welcome to The Lid, your afternoon dose of the 2016 ethos\u2026 President Obama has received a heavily guarded advanced screening of the newest season of \"Game of Thrones,\" the show's creators revealed. That perk is really the only explanation as to why, like, 100 people ran for president this cycle.   '16 from 30,000: John Kasich's campaign is growing frustrated with the anti-Trump movement for what they claim is its transparent transformation into a pro-Ted Cruz movement, NBC News' Leigh Ann Caldwell and Kailani Koenig report. The Kasich camp's not-so-subtle message is that the effort has not given the Ohio governor support in states where he could make gains against the GOP frontrunner. Sure, there is evidence to support that complaint -- for instance, the stop Trump efforts are essentially ignoring New York so far, where Cruz is in third place and where a strong performance by Trump could leave him with all of the state's 95 delegates. And other anti-Trump groups, like the Club for Growth, have expressly supported Cruz. But Team Kasich's complaints would hold a lot more weight if the candidate had been able to win more than one state so far. In fact, he still trails Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the race on March 15, in delegates. March 15, coincidentally, is also the last time Kasich gained a delegate. So the Stop Trump movement's gravitation to Cruz is not a matter of favoritism but practicality. And though many in the GOP believe a two-term swing state governor would fare better in the general election than a firebrand conservative, Kasich's window to establish himself as the primary anti-Trump alternative has largely closed.    POPPING ON NBC POLITICS  John Kasich's campaign feels the stop-Trump movement seems to have morphed into pro-Cruz movement, NBC's Leigh Ann Caldwell and Kailani Koenig report.   With or without Paul Ryan, a \"white knight\" at the GOP convention is unlikely, NBC's Marianna Sotomayor reports.   Bernie Sanders was cheered like a rock star while visiting striking Verizon employees in Brooklyn on Wednesday.  Hillary Clinton encouraged voters to repudiate the \"bigotry\" of Trump and Cruz during a speech to the National Action Network.  And from First Read: Why Hillary Clinton was the real winner in Paul Ryan's no-go.    FOR THE RECORD\u2026  \"I'm a 21st century thinker. As somebody said, 'You're really a millennial in an older man's body.'\"  -- John Kasich to reporters while campaigning in Catonsville, Maryland.    TOMORROW'S SKED  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are in New York City. Trump also campaigns in the Empire State.  John Kasich joins Chris Matthews for a town hall airing at 7 p.m. ET on MSNBC.

        "Title": "#GOTscience: Could You Actually Ride a 'Game of Thrones' Dragon?",
        "Publication": "NBC",
        "Text": " Despite the stunning CGI effects on view in the latest episode of HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" sword-and-sorcery series, giant flying dragons don't exist. But if they did, could a dragon queen ride them?  The question doesn't apply merely to Queen Daenerys' dragons, but also to the giant eagles in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and the pterosaurs in the \"Jurassic Park\" movies. Based on some off-the-cuff calculations, your best bet is to ride the pterosaurs.  \"The 'Lord of the Ring' eagles would have more of a problem\" than pterosaurs \u2014 or even dragons \u2014 when it comes to bearing theoretical burdens, said Michael Habib, a paleontologist at the University of Southern California who specializes in prehistoric flight dynamics.  That's because of the way different animals are built for flight: Eagles rank among the most powerful modern-day fliers, but a lot of their musculature goes into the legs and talons as well as the wings. If you scaled up an eagle's wings for Hobbit-carrying capability, you'd have to scale up all that extra bulk as well.  More than 65 million years ago, the biggest pterosaurs \u2014 which might have been Quetzalcoatlus or Hatzegopteryx \u2014 were better-built for pure flight: Not only did they have a bigger wingspan (more than 35 feet vs. 8 feet for real-life eagles), but their wings were also made of lightweight membranes rather than feathers over flesh.  Related: Could Dragons Fly and Breathe Fire?  Habib's calculations suggest that a pterosaur's wings could lift a maximum of 500 pounds, maybe more. That's close to the creature's estimated weight \u2014 but if the creature had a slightly more efficient build than the anatomical models suggest, carrying a 100-pound human would be within the realm of possibility.  \"The physics does not actually prevent a rideable flying animal from existing, but it has to be a specific type of flying animal,\" Habib said. \"The physics does prevent a 20-ton dragon from existing.\"  Even if pterosaurs co-existed with humans \u2014 which they didn't \u2014 staying on top of the reptile would tax the best rodeo rider. Aerodynamic modeling suggests that pterosaurs didn't necessarily take off with a running start, as Daenerys' dragon did on \"Game of Thrones.\" Instead, the current leading hypothesis is that pterosaurs used their winged limbs to push off the ground for a leaping launch.  \"You'd have to be really strapped in,\" Habib said.  Related: 'Dragon' Pterosaur Flies Right Out of the Movies  Have there been any documented cases of birds taking humans for a ride? A couple of years ago, Canadian animation students created a viral video hoax that made it look as if an eagle was pulling a toddler off the ground \u2014 but the real-life evidence for baby-grabbing birds is sketchy at best. Even the biggest birds of prey can lift no more than a few pounds into the air.  So the next time you see a dragon carrying off a fair maiden, rest assured that you're watching magic at work \u2014 either the age-old magic of Westeros and the stranger realms to the east, or the newfangled magic of Hollywood special effects.  Update for 5:15 p.m. ET June 9: On the subject of an eagle's carrying capacity, Oscar Macias Ramirez points to this video from the late documentary filmmaker Felix Rodriguez de la Fuente, which shows a golden eagle pulling a kid goat off a cliff. The video was remarkable enough to draw comment from evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne a couple of years ago. It seems unlikely that the eagle could have lifted the goat up into the air; nevertheless, the video demonstrates that this is one bird you don't want to mess with.

        "Publication": "NBC",
        "Text": " \"Game of Thrones\" fans are all abuzz over the shocking final scene of this week's episode in the sex-swords-and-sorcery TV series (spoiler alert!), and even author George R.R. Martin was pensive about HBO's departure from his books' plot line. But the show also explored a familiar subject: deadly substances and their uses.  Poison has popped up repeatedly in the fictional saga \u2014 for example, in the painful, choking death of King Joffrey, due to the effect of a concoction known as \"the Strangler.\" In a later episode, a slower-acting poison laid low a musclebound knight known as the Mountain \u2014 and set him up for what many suspect will be a head transplant (or is that a body transplant?).  This time, there's a more poignant motivation for the use of poison: to provide the \"gift\" of death to those who can no longer endure life. This lethal liquid is as clear as water, and causes its victims to pass away painlessly. It's as close as \"Game of Thrones\" comes to the debate over euthanasia \u2014 a debate that goes back to ancient Greece.  The best-known case from those days focuses on the philosopher Socrates, who drank a cup of poisonous hemlock to avoid suffering a more painful punishment for his alleged impiety. Even with hemlock, suicide wasn't painless. Although Plato's account makes it sound as if his mentor died stoically, experts say the nerve-disrupting poison in hemlock plants (a nicotine-like substance known as coniine) would have caused suffocation and convulsions.  A better analog to the poison used in Braavos' House of Black and White is sodium thiopental, which is today's drug of choice for euthanasia and executions. A little bit of the barbiturate supposedly acts as a \"truth serum,\" calming anxiety and dulling pain. A little more serves as an anesthetic. A lot of it shuts down the nervous system for good.  Sodium thiopental has been in the news recently: There's a nationwide shortage of the drug, in part because of the controversy over its use in carrying out death penalties. Will Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was given the death penalty last week after his conviction in the Boston Marathon bombing case, ever get that lethal dose? That real-life saga is likely to take far longer to play out than \"Game of Thrones.\"  For yet another angle on the poisons of \"Game of Thrones,\" check out this spoiler-filled recap from Vanity Fair.

        "Title": "#GOTscience: Reality Check on Gruesome Twists in 'Game of Thrones'",
        "Publication": "NBC",
        "Text": " This season's episodes of \"Game of Thrones,\" HBO's sex-sword-and-sorcery series, haven't been for the fainthearted: The show's plot twists have included the troubling rape of a sympathetic character, another character being burned alive, one learning to practice euthanasia, at least one suffering a terrible disease, and yet another being set up for what appears to be a head transplant.  The latest show provides further examples of the fictional society of Westeros \"going medieval\" or even farther back \u2014 including fights to the death, torture by flaying and religious extremism. But as gruesome as they may seem, the practices that are worked into the script have some basis in actual history. Here's a reality check on a few of the twists from this week's episode.  One of the characters on the show, Lancel Lannister, has become so religious that he has a seven-pointed star carved into his forehead. Where does that come from?  \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin recently told Entertainment Weekly that he modeled the Faith Militant, the cult that Lancel Lannister joins, after \"the medieval Catholic Church, with its own fantasy twist.\" Although carving crosses into the foreheads of the faithful weren't part of the practice back then, branding with a hot iron was used as a form of punishment for heretics and criminals.  The Middle Ages also brought the phenomenon known as stigmata \u2014 that is, the appearance of wounds on the hands and feet, and sometimes in the side, of an ardent believer. Such wounds mirror the accounts of Jesus' wounds in the crucifixion. The scientific study of stigmata has been murky, but the non-supernatural explanations range from psychosomatic bleeding (for example, psychogenic purpuras) to self-mutilation, perhaps inflicted unconsciously while in the throes of a spiritual state.  What about torture by flaying?  The practice of skinning captives goes back at least to the Assyrians, according to the \"History Behind Game of Thrones\" blog. A wall relief from the palace of King Sennacherib shows prisoners apparently being flayed alive after the capture of the city of Lachish in 701 B.C.  The practice is recorded in medieval European history as well \u2014 most notably to punish the young bowman who killed King Richard the Lionheart in 1199. But death by flaying wasn't nearly as common in 12th-century England as it is in the fictional realm of House Bolton (whose motto is \"Our Knives Are Sharp\").  One scene shows fighters battling each other in a gladiator-style game until only one is left alive. Seems like an awful waste of gladiators. Is that the way the Romans did it?  Not usually. Historical accounts suggest that the loser survived the overwhelming majority of gladiatorial fights. If a professional gladiator died in combat, the sponsor of the games often was required to pay compensation to the fighter's manager.  \"Keep in mind that the lanista \u2014 the owner of the gladiator school \u2014 had a sizable investment in these professional fighters,\" historical novelist James Duffy observes in his roundup of common gladiatorial misconceptions. \"If he were to lose half his fighting force in each arena show, he would be out of business very quickly.\"  Another scene shows a character coming close to death after being wounded by a poisoned sword, only to be revived instantly after taking a sip of the antidote. Do antidotes work that quickly in real life?  In a word, no.  \"Antidotes are not instant; basically they're playing catchup with the effect of the poison,\" Deborah Blum, author of \"The Poisoner's Handbook,\" told NBC News in an email. \"They tend to work by binding up the agent in the bloodstream (prussian blue to block thallium absorption, for example) or by competing for receptors (the use of ethanol to treat antifreeze poisoning). They do need to be given in reasonable time.\"  Blum referred to a thallium poisoning case in New Jersey that unfolded back in 2011. A knowledgeable nurse caught on to what was going on \u2014 but by the time the antidote was administered, \"it was too late,\" she said. The victim's estranged wife, a chemist, was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.  \"Of course you can get a rapid alleviation of symptoms with some treatments \u2014 say, oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning,\" Blum said. \"But there's nothing that instantly counters a poison that I know, except in fiction.\"  Got scientific questions about scenes from \"Game of Thrones\"?

        "Text": "Warning: Spoilers below for anyone who has miraculously managed to avoid discovering what happens at the end of \"Game of Thrones\" Season 5. You are a unicorn. Go, unicorn.\nValar morghulis. But -- surely not Jon Snow?\nSince Season 5's calamitous finale, nearly everyone involved with\u00a0\"Game of Thrones\" has been asked about the bastard Stark's final fate. We saw Jon stabbed by his former allies of the Night's Watch, but there are several ways he could conceivably come back to the show\u00a0-- from leading the White Walkers to being resurrected by Melisandre's Lord of Light. Or maybe he's just dead.\u00a0Gone. Done.\nWe'll find out for certain when the series resumes on Sunday. Until then, why not indulge ourselves by completely overanalyzing every quasi-revealing thing \"Game of Thrones\" insiders have said about what might happen with Kit Harington's character in Season 6? Surely they all chose their words very, very carefully.\u00a0\nCast members and other insiders are pretty much on the same page as far as Jon's death goes -- he did\u00a0get stabbed a lot --\u00a0but they're less united on whether that means he can't come back.\u00a0We scored each of their thoughts on a scale from 0\u00a0(dead is dead is dead) to 10 (what is dead may never die) crossed swords to evaluate the odds that Jon comes back, starting with the man himself:\nKit Harington (Jon Snow)\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694 / 10\n\"I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m not coming back next season. So that\u2019s all I can tell you, really,\" the actor said in\u00a0a June interview with EW. Not coming back means he's probably not resurrected in any form. Yet this is an older comment, and Harington has since been spotted filming on set, so we'll take it with a grain of salt.\u00a0\n\"People didn\u2019t want me to die, but he\u2019s dead. So there you go, everyone has to get used to it.\"\u00a0In a January interview with Digital Spy, the actor\u00a0sounded pretty sure of himself. Then again, White Walkers are technically dead.\u00a0\n\"All I can tell you is Jon Snow is dead. He died at the end of last season,\"\u00a0Harington said on BBC Breakfast\u00a0in January. That doesn't mean he won't come back.\u00a0\n\"I filmed some scenes of me being dead --\u00a0it\u2019s some of my best work,\" he joked. Speaking\u00a0to Time Out London\u00a0in March, the actor also said he knows precisely how long he plays a corpse, possibly suggesting there is post-corpse life for Jon.\u00a0Dan Weiss (Showrunner, \"Game of Thrones\")\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694 / 10\n\"We would hope that after seeing the scene,\u00a0and the way it\u2019s shot, that the answer to that will be unambiguous in the minds of the people watching it.\"\u00a0OK,\u00a0Weiss\u00a0told EW in June\u00a0what we should take from the stabbing at that point in the series -- he's dead. But is that how Jon's story ends? If writers and producers wanted to surprise viewers, of course they'd try to make us think Jon died.\u00a0\nJohn Bradley (Samwell Tarly)\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694 / 10\n\"I won\u2019t see him again, and it really did feel like the end of a chapter of our relationship ...\u00a0It feels like the book\u2019s been closed on that, and it\u2019s been beautiful.\" Bradley also\u00a0told\u00a0The Huffington Post in June it was\u00a0\"heartbreaking\" to film the final scenes of Season 5, making that ending sound way too final for our liking.\u00a0\n\"It\u2019s more terrible for me that Kit\u2019s not going to be on set every day.\"\u00a0Considering Harington has definitely been spotted on set, this comment to Digital Spy doesn't make a lot of sense. Sam is not a good liar.\u00a0\nNikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister)\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694 / 10\n\"Whenever I meet someone, I just say 'Jon Snow is dead.' Sometimes, of course, I\u2019m in a shop and the poor person there just says, 'Yeah, it\u2019ll be $12.50 please.'\"\u00a0Coster-Waldau channeled his character's smart mouth with Jimmy Kimmel in February. \"Spoiler: At the end of Season 5, he\u2019s dead,\" he said. Again, that doesn't mean he\u00a0stays\u00a0that way.\u00a0\n\"I say, 'He\u2019s dead.' It\u2019s not hard -- because he\u2019s dead,\" the actor said when questioned about how often he's asked to discuss Jon Snow's situation. The actor essentially repeated his earlier comments when he spoke to EW in March.\u00a0Maisie Williams (Arya Stark)\u00a0\u2694\u2694 /\u00a010\n\"If it makes you feel better, then, yes there\u2019s hope but ... there\u2019s no hope.\" Speaking to E! News in July, the actress also commented on how \"people are trying to be very positive\" about Jon's fate -- but Williams isn't much of an optimist in that regard. \"We saw him get stabbed a lot. Like, I think that\u2019s pretty clear.\" Then again, she likes\u00a0to have fun with fans of the series, so you never know.\u00a0\n\"No, he\u2019s dead. Sorry.\"\u00a0Williams had a smug reply when asked about Jon on the Emmys red carpet in September.\u00a0Dead. Gone.\u00a0\n\"All the time people are asking me if Jon Snow is alive and the answer is no! He\u2019s dead! I promise.\"\u00a0The actress\u00a0promised on Absolute Radio\u00a0in October --\u00a0but we'll refer you to the White Walker or warg theories.\u00a0\n\"I feel so mean because I speak to people and they\u2019re all like 'Jon Snow, is he back?' And it\u2019s really heartbreaking because people are like, 'Yeah, but he\u2019s coming back, though?' It\u2019s a great twist but I can\u2019t say he\u2019s going to be alive.\"\u00a0A GREAT TWIST? Of course Williams couldn't\u00a0say\u00a0anything definitively at a red carpet event in January. And the\u00a0\"twist\"\u00a0might simply be Jon's surprise stabbing --\u00a0but it could also be his surprise stabbing\u00a0and subsequent resurrection.\u00a0\nNatalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell)\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u00a0/ 10\n\"If you get stabbed that many times, you\u2019re dead, you know. There are some basic medical rules that even apply in Westeros.

People want him to be alive so much, you could just exhale and they\u2019ll find a way to say, 'That means Jon Snow\u2019s alive,'\" Clarke said before presumably exhaling.\u00a0Like other cast members, she told EW in March she gets the Jon Snow question all the time.\nSophie Turner (Sansa Stark)\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u00a0/ 10\n\"I think I\u2019m kind of with Emilia.\u00a0It\u2019s 'Game of Thrones,' so anything can happen.

The man is dead!\" At a\u00a0November panel discussion, Cunningham retold Nutter's story. Yet perhaps the director has fewer scruples about telling half-truths to world leaders.\u00a0\n\"But they don't want to believe it's true. How many knives does a man need in his chest to be dead? And if you say Jon Snow can't be dead, that means Ned Stark can't be dead.\"\u00a0... Fair. But Jon Snow is\u00a0freshly\u00a0dead.

The actress told the WSJ's Speakeasy blog,\u00a0\"It's funny that there's so much pressure on my character to bring him back because I don't think I've ever brought anyone back from the dead.\" But there's a first time for everything, and the Lord of Light has done it before.\u00a0\nAlfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy)\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u00a0/ 10\n\"He lives on -- not physically.\"\u00a0In March, EW asked cast members\u00a0how often they are asked about Jon snow. (Often.) Predictably, Theon gave the worst answer. \"Lives on\" in our hearts? \"Lives on\" through Ghost? What is it?\nOwen Teale\u00a0(Ser Alliser Thorne) 0 / 10\n\"I really miss Jon Snow and Kit who played him. But if he came back to life, the show would turn into a soap opera that wouldn\u2019t know how to come to an end.\"\u00a0Teale -- who participated in the stab-fest\u00a0-- told Greek magazine Athinorama in July that he appreciates how \"the audience can really feel death and loss\" on \"Game of Thrones.\" Oh, but whose character gave us all those feelings last season?\u00a0\nMichael Lombardo (HBO Programming President)\u00a0\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694\u2694 / 10\n\"Dead is dead is dead.\u00a0He be dead. Yes. Everything I\u2019ve seen, heard and read, he is dead.\"\u00a0Lombardo\u00a0did not mince words at\u00a0a Television Critics' Association press tour in July.

        "Text": "Ian McShane has some harsh words for \"Game of Thrones\" fans who feel he's been too free with information about the upcoming season during interviews. \"You say the slightest thing and the Internet goes ape,\" McShane told the Telegraph. \"I was accused of giving the plot away, but I just think get a f**king life. It's only t**s and dragons.\"Fans of the show, beware of potential season 6 spoilers below.\n                                            McDreamy, Zoe Barnes, and now ANOTHER favorite \"Game of Thrones\" character... how DARE they\n                                    At issue are McShane's previous comments about his mysterious, as-yet-unnamed character on the hugely popular fantasy series.Back in November, he told Pop Goes the News that his character wouldn't be sticking around long. \"[It's] a one-off episode,\" he told the website. \"I'm responsible for bringing somebody back that you think you're never going to see again. I'll leave it at that.\" His comment that easily fed into the already fervent speculation about the fate of Kit Harington's character, Jon Snow.And if his above comment about the Internet didn't make it clear, he hasn't changed his approach to discussing the show despite its usual cloak of secrecy.\"They asked me if I wanted to do 'Game of Thrones' and I said, 'Sure, I'll be able to see my old pals Charlie Dance and Stephen Dillane,' and they said, 'No, we've killed them off,'\" McShane tells the Telegraph in describing how he'd come on board. \"I wasn't sure whether I could commit, but then they said it would only be for one episode, so I said, 'So that means I must die at the end of it. Great, I'm in.'\"",

        "Publication": "CBS News",
        "Text": "Does the new \"Game of Thrones\" trailer settle the Jon Snow debate for good?Possibly, considering that it opens with a shot of Snow (Kit Harington) lying in the snow after suffering multiple stab wounds at the end of last season, accompanied by a voice-over declaring, \"He's gone.\"But fans of the hit HBO show know it's likely far from that simple. The new trailer, released Tuesday, offers the most in-depth look so far at the series' much-anticipated sixth season, including developments for revenge-hungry Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) and recently captured Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), all set to a haunting cover of Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\" by ames Vincent McMorrow.The new season begins April 24, not that fans need to be reminded of that.",

We listen. And we remember.  The past is already written. The ink is dry.\"Although Jon Snow is featured prominently in the teaser, there's still no definite indication whether he's actually returning for another season. After all, wasn't it \"GOT\" director who said, \"Jon Snow is dead\" earlier this year?The teaser ends with the fitting line: \"They have no idea what's going to happen.\"This is quite true. \"Game of Thrones\" returns for season 6 in April.",
